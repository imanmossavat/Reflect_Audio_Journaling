## 🌟 What is REFLECT?
Most AI tools send your voice to a server in the cloud. **REFLECT is different.** 
- **Private:** Processes everything on your own machine.
- **Transcribes:** Turns your voice into text automatically.
- **Analyzes:** Finds "PII" (private info), splits talk into topics, and checks mood/tone.
- **Searchable:** Search your journals by meaning, not just exact words.
