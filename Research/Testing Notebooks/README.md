# Testing Notebooks

This folder contains Jupyter notebooks used to explore and test
individual AI features in isolation.

## Examples
- Transcription enhancement
- Topic segmentation
- Semantic search
- Data validation
- Algorithm comparisons

## Purpose
- Rapid experimentation
- Visual inspection of outputs
- Early validation before backend integration

## Notes
- Notebooks are exploratory and not standardized
- Some notebooks overlap in scope intentionally
