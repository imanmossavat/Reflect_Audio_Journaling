      " This afternoon I talked with Lisa Jacobs when I got off the train at Eindhoven Central Station. She told me that later today she has to go to Amsterdam Zout for an appointment at ING Bank. I reminded her that last week she accidentally sent a letter to Nachte Helan 14 while it actually should have been Nachte Helan 14b. After that, I walked past Albert Hein, where I ran into my colleague Ruben. He said he received an email yesterday from team HR informing everyone that they are expected on Monday, February 12th at 9.30 for a short meeting. When I got home, I saw that my package from bold.com had finally been delivered. Apparently, the delivery driver left it with our neighbor, the Groot. There was also a note in the living room from my mom asking if I could come by Thursday in Tilburg because Aunt Maria is celebrating her birthday. At the end of the afternoon I received a message from Hassan asking if I wanted to join him at Stripe S around 1845 to get something to eat. I told him I wasn't sure yet because I first need to wait for a confirmation from Professor Peters about my appointment on Friday.\n",
