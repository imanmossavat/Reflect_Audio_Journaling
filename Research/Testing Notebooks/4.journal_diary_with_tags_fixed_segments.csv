"I've been trying to lose weight for years just to find a boyfriend but my weight keeps fluxuating. Also, nothing helps anymore. I'm obese, and I've just come to terms with being obese at this point because for the past 8 years I've been doing nothing but losing weight and trying to be prettier for male validation and I've had enough of it. Guys don't like me at any size. When I was at my skinniest 170lbs at 15 years old, boys in my class would ask me out as a joke. When I was at my heaviest 260lbs creeps would sexually harass me. Men never see that I am good enough for them because they're stupid, and can't see what's right in front of them. So I just give up. I guess I'm giving up on getting married one day, I probably will never get married because men are too stupid to see that I am worthy enough of their love and affection. I might as well give up on finding love and just masturbate to porn for the rest of my life.","1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0","boyfriend,skinniest,affection",positive,affection,"validation,affection,prettier,never,masturbate"

"Ive tried to let her go. I tell myself every morning, Today is the day you finally release her.
And every morning, I fail.

Shes everywhere. In the way I move, the way I breathe, the way laughter escapes me, the way songs hit my chest like they were written for her alone. Shes not gone she lives in my veins, pulses through my heart, burns in my soul, and terrifies me with how alive she makes me feel.

People call it obsession, call it weakness. They dont understand that loving someone like this isnt a choice its a force of nature. Its fire and ice, chaos and calm, ecstasy and heartbreak all at once. And Im trapped inside it, willingly, helplessly.

Shes my mirror, my lesson, my addiction. Shes raw, shes real, shes funny, shes chaos and peace in the same breath. Shes the only person Ive ever known who sees me without masks, without walls, without pretense and who I feel the same way about.

I know she felt it too. Thats why this hurts so much. I send her money. I care in silence. I ache while she barely knows I exist. I dont do it to manipulate, or guilt, or pressure. I do it because she is part of me now, and maybe always will be.

I want her to live her life. I want her to be free. I want her to be happy. But ripping her out of my heart would be like ripping myself apart. I cant. I wont.

She is one of a kind. She is fire, she is soul, she is light, she is chaos, she is laughter, she is everything. And Ill carry her with me burning, aching, alive whether shes here or not.

"As a full time single dad, like most single parents I have spent the last four years of mostly just work and home. Needless to say time around a woman has been nonexistent. After years of attempting to date and getting burned out with the nonsense games, fakes, or just engaging with others really not seeking an irl friendship or dynamic. I simply put finding a partner in the bag of pipe dreams and just let it go. Yet the other day , while taking my child out for dinner, I had this random conversation with a lady who was also waiting to be seated. It was a friendly conversation, that I didnt really pay any attention to, beyond small talk. However when I spoke of it to my work friend, I was told , I completely missed all the signs, as this lady and I spoke , she would continuously grab my arm soft and gentle as if she was feeling how strong my arms where, her constant smile from ear to ear, or repeatedly making comments as to where she would be located on certain days of the week , like a restaurant, coffee shop, etc. repeated comments on how shes single etc. How after we were seated for dinner across the room from each other , her constant stare my way as her friends were trying to talk to her over dinner etc. I never really paid it attention at the time as Ive just been so use to the constant rejection us single dads receive or the lack of interest of woman wanting a full time single dad for dating. I just didnt think anything about it . Yet my guy friend at work told me her actions were all signs she was interested in me. But I just didnt feel it, or maybe I just didnt believe it anymore in love, romance and fairy tails. So now he has me constantly wondering , did I miss the so called One I dont have any female friends so dont have any other perspective than his. Its so frustrating trying to make a connection , I wonder if it will take a cave man approach of being bonked on the head and dragged off to get my attention or to feel like your actually wanted.

"Not every hugs are same. And also it maybe different for persons. That happiness and peace given by a warm hug is priceless. A crowded and disturbed mind can be easily cool down just by a holding with some other persons hug. Even it can be a side hug casual hug or even a tight  hug .

  In the end ,those good bye hugs are always touchy, we'll do it tight and spell it out or not we mean our words.. until next time buddy

"Within everything I do, I never know. I dont know the outcome. I try my best to stay strong and not let my mind control me but every night I cant help but feel a deep ache within my head, it makes me feel sick, I need to be rid of it, but I dont want to seem reliant. If my life was to spectate everyone else I could live with it, only because people act in such mysterious ways. The love I have isnt love, its just a fear of pain, my whole life Ive bottled every single emotion, action, and all for what. I am still in the same spot, just with scars carved into who I am. I feel as I am my own spectator, I can not choose my own actions, I dont control my thoughts, I feel like an accumulation of beings and minds strapped to one body, a body that wants to be free, my only wish is to be able to fly, if the world stopped spinning would my head stop too. If I stopped spinning the world will not ever notice, I am in different to the outcomes now, and yet a part of my mind still yearns for the moment that someone else will be my wings, someone else will hold me and care for my wounds. The wounds that are disregarded by my own self and every other person. No one has the empathy I seek, no one can care or understand the emotions I strive to release, I feel as though I hallucinate every single person I come across, never knowing whats real and what is fake. I no longer care whats real, I just want to feel real, the world can spread its lies but I wont, even if I continue to lie to myself. I could never write or articulate anything of my own, when I try my body and mind separate, my hands write and my eyes read, my mind processes and it keeps going, losing energy and life every moment I live. There is so much to live for and yet I care not for it. The people I surround myself with the people who surround me, I can sense their disbelief in life, they will never know that I cant be comfortable around anything, why would I be, if you lived in a picture that was always the same would you, if you lived in a puzzle that felt like it had so much potential but only ended up being the same picture every time would you ever care to change. Why does my head create a space in which living is a constant drain. Why should I ever need to rely on anyone, if no one will rely on me, the world wouldnt notice, I wouldnt notice, but I want to, I wish to see everything, feel everything, I never want to miss a moment, but all moments feel dull. If the world was painted over and began a new it would end the same. My head can never agree, my body can never feel what it wants, I mindlessly drone through the day. With every brush of the wind, with all the sound carried around me, it all becomes to much, theres no longer any time left. When did time become such an amenity, why cant we live in simple world, when where people stop complaining, the more given is the more taken, the more taken is the more wanted. If I could fly I would not yearn for the sky, I would yearn to see everything, all the sunsets around the world, my head is always in a daze constantly creating new things it wants, why is there so many people in my head, I feel crazy, why must I narrate every moment, my mental state is detached from my body, my body is not one. It creates new moments for itself but never agrees, I stare blankly, I see things, bugs everywhere, I never feel clean, I always am bothered, by the touch of nothing, by everything I touch, everything all the sounds smells tastes thoughts, why is there so much noise, why is there so impure, I want nothing but to calm my mind it spins and is in pain, but I cant tell where, what part is in pain, why does my mind split into fragments the way a mirror breaks, all reflecting parts of a whole, but it itself is never whole. You can see a whole world through a piece of mirror but never the whole unbroken picture. I cant relate to people who complain, feel sorrow because my mind forgets feelings, it cannot comprehend loss, I cant ever comprehend anything but I see everything. And noticing things in the world is the most painful glimpse into death, that makes death seem like a dream, if I was to die, would people carryon, would they ever know my story, if I cannot understand the world how would it ever understand me, I write this using one part of my brain as another talks in the back, and another dreams of the beachs I hate, if I worked together with myself would I become whole, I cant understand. Why does every aspect of me feel disgusting and disconnected from itself, how am I too, ever know what the world feels like. I am nothing but a person a mirage of the whole world looking into itself. Im an idiot for believing that the pain of, loss, heart break, rejection, voices, would ever leave, my mind is constantly draining more from itself than it can bear, I cant sleep, why would I, sleep carries no gratitude it carries no relief, I will still have to create a new mind tomorrow and live the life I had yesterday with new pre-tenses, all my sense are heightened and dulled, everything around me drives me to insanity yet I know the ways of people and lashing out, or talking from my heart is not allowed, people care for mediocrity they cant see past there nose or hear past their shoulder, lies are more interesting to them, they wouldnt understand anything, I am an idiot but the world is stupid, why should I care about politics if people have their own issues that need tending, I am a mistake, the room spins around and I dissolve, my whole body cant shake my mistakes, all the people I have wronged trying to do the right thing, I will never forgive myself, my mind is shattered, my emotions belong to the people in my head, those people all have their own emotions, I am a person with no thoughts, I am controlled by many and owned by none. I dont feel crazy but I feel like the world is crazy, they cannot grasp ideas and personal ideals. I just want to cry but I cant for it doesnt work that way, people hate and love to hate, but cant love without hate, they refuse to accept anything, everyone is partial to the devil and earns a spot in hell, the world is our own damnation, it is the end of the line, we will not escape, death does not do us part, it keeps us trapped in the field of hatred we created and surround ourselves in, I will wake tomorrow and not remember the feelings I wrote this with, and that will happen everyday, for everyday is a new day for me and my mind is broken, abused and hurt.","1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1","within,control,different,world,constantly,understand,health,work",positive,calmness,"accumulation,mediocrity,spectator,rejection,damnation"

I hope youre doing okay. I hope your holidays are as beautiful and warm as I remember you.

Was I on your mind last night Our songs played over and over as I slept, oddly in sync with each other. Perhaps it was simply a dream cuddling me from afar. I don't know...

Would you remember me Its been almost a year now since we let eachother go. 

My Christmas wish to you, is that youre smiling right now and living your best life beside someone special, someone who loves you the way you deserve. That no matter what happens you find harmony in your heart. You are much more beautiful person than you allowed yourself to be. 

Darkness can prevail our fears, but it's only a shadow you claimed, not the truth naked as bare as the heart beating for love it longs to obtain.

"Journal Entry: 2025-12-02

I'm tired...

Last weekend, I wanted to have the difficult conversation with my wife. However, I caught a cold and wasn't able to talk to her alone without the kids around. I ended up going to bed first every night...

Now, her birthday is next weekend, so I feel like it would be heartless to have the talk then. But at the same time, I'm suffering so much inside... Also, she wants to buy the airplane tickets for our summer vacation this week, so I am running out of time.

I decided that the next time we talk about the tickets, I will tell her that I've been struggling a lot and that I need more timeat least until Januaryto sort out my feelings. She will ask questions, and I am prepared to tell her that I care about her and our family, but I feel like a roommate and the love just isn't there anymore.

I feel guilty for my feelings; its very tough. I know what needs to be done, Im just scared...

"December 2nd.
Another night of broken sleep
on and off, drifting, drowning, resurfacing.
And the same heaviness in my chest,
that weight that never fully leaves.

I hate that my body still reacts to him.
I hate that when he finally turned around
and pulled me close,
my nervous system calmed down
like it still believes hes home.
Like it still believes hes safety.
But hes not.

And in that half-conscious fog,
I whispered to myself:
Its okay we will be apart one day anyway.
Dead or alive.
A truth,
a defense,
a small shield for my heart.

He kissed me goodbye this morning.
A routine gesture.
Nothing special.
But the moment he walked out,
my own brain stabbed me awake with his old words
No matter how bad I am, please dont leave me.
The line he fed me before vacation.
The line he used to tie me to him.
While planning the exact thing
that would destroy us.

And my chest tightened again.
A physical ache.
A betrayal memory that sits in my ribs
like a bruise that doesnt heal.

I dont want to think about him anymore.
Not about the lies,
not about the stories,
not about the versions he plays.

I want to be here.
In the present.
In my own mind, not trapped in his.

My sister tells me,
You should think about something else too.
And I hate that shes right.
Because all of this thinking
has done nothing but drag me backward.

Today, I want to fight my own thoughts.
Today, I want my heart back.
Even if it trembles.
Even if it hurts.
I hope I can do it.","1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0","december,family,defense,goodbye,moment,thoughts,today",mixed,calmness,"heaviness,december,vacation,another,moment"
"I did it again. Someone ended things between us and instead of letting things go I pushed and pushed and pushed in an attempt to regain connection, until finally they cut me out entirely. I do this every time. I lose someone and then I chase them until Im sure there will never be a future with them. Its a weird anxiously attached coping mechanism. Its like I need to push them to the point where they are just as disgusted with me as I am with myself. I need us both to dislike me in order for me to move on. Its nearly compulsive at this point. I feel this nervous energy in me when I dont complete the cycle. 

I dont know what I would even do if someone actually stayed. 

The stability of a steady love terrifies me. The chase is exciting. The chase is familiar. Yearning for what I dont have is comfortable. Living in a fantasy world where people secretly still want me is comfortable. Coming to terms with endings feels dangerous. The prospect of healthy reciprocal love feels dangerous.

The hardest part of these endings isnt necessarily the actual ending. Its more so the memories of how excited they were when they first started getting to know me. I remember how they were enthusiastic about being around me. I remember how much they liked talking to me. It sits in stark contrast to where we are now  not talking, turning back into strangers now that Ive scared them away with the wounded child that comes out when I feel myself losing a connection. 

I dont know if I even am capable of healthy love. All I know is fightflight. Anything else feels too risky.","1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0","topic,anxiously,stability,reciprocal",mixed,anxiety,"connection,mechanism,stability,remember,never"

"So after a lot has come to light about the infidelity of my ex during the relationship with my friends wife.. i've been going through the ringer. Just the complete and total betrayal and the fact they still try and lie and hide about how they got together. Damn. It just angers me. 

However Whilst it genuinely fuels my blood with how narcissistic and toxic they both are.. i didn't fall apart. I didn't fall back into unhealthy habits of self destruct and think I was broken or not enough.. instead I thought that I was enough, even when I had thoughts of not being alive anymore I still gave my all to that relationship and did my best. It was him that wasn't enough and maybe not even ready to know what real love is. Its difficult at times but its being there for your partner and loving them through all their lows and highs. 

I was made to feel like I was a completely broken, worthless and unlovable person but I wasn't. But I didn't spiral this time I took a moment and thought a relationship built upon a lie, cruelty and dishonesty will never be a truly happy one and they will do what they did to us to each other and when it does.. i'll pity them because they threw away so much for a moment being chased. 

I know my worth, I know who I am and more importantly I am happy. Happiest I have been in a long time and thriving.

"2025 December 2: Dear Diary,

Well, the snow has finally started. This means I will probably not leave the house much until after Imbolc. I will not let this get in the way of my improvement. Instead of wallowing around in a depression for the Winter, I can choose to focus on directing love and discipline towards myself.  
  
I can also always practice being more social and natural at work. Being natural takes a lot of discipline. It seems that when I am in public I am crippled with anxiety and when I am in private I am suffocated by ennui. This must not continue. I want to participate in life and not feel bad about it.

"i think to hurt is something our kind is the most familiar with. living hurts. awareness hurts. feelings hurt. maybe that's why babies cry all the time. their freshly new awareness can't bear the hurt. maybe with time adults cry less because they grow more accustomed to hurt. every single aspect of their life includes experiencing hurt. even the road to pleasure goes through hurt, so they're more comfortable with it, more at peace with it. hurt becomes familiar to them. to love someone hurts, to care for someone hurts, to find something so cute and adorable and the ability to feel affection to such lengths hurts. it hurts the most though when those feelings aren't reciprocated. hurt becomes a catalyst for personal development. hurt might be the thing that makes us feel alive. for some, hurt is thrill. especially those into BDSM, to them hurt is pleasure. hurt teaches you so many things. hurt also allows you to understand the value of things you have. I've seen people go their entire lives finding love, but I've never seen someone not find hurt. maybe the point of our lives is to find someone or something with whom hurting is more preferable. we're all hurting. maybe we can choose what hurt is the hurt we wanna feel. maybe we can choose for whom to hurt, who deserves our hurt. for hurting is precious, and to hurt for someone in this way is so beautiful.","1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0","familiar,affection",positive,affection,"development,awareness,affection,ability,never"

"Nobody talks about what happens after someone is saved from suicide.
You always see it in the headlines,
A heroic display of humanity,
Man is saved from suicide

When someone is staring down at the water neath the bridge,
And someone runs in to grab them just before they can jump,
It's beautiful, it's selfless, it's awesome,
And that's where the story for us ends.

But for the man on the bridge,
What happens next
Will an employer keep a worker whos mentally unsound
Will the government force him into psychiatric care or a mental institution
How will his friends and family react
Where will they go in a world they once deemed too cruel to live in

I am living in this life, silently
I was staring into the water below, when I was pulled down from the railing, not by any hand,
But by my own guilt, sadness, and spite.

I feel as though my soul has been shattered.
I go to work, I come home, I laugh with my friends, I play videogames, I chat with my girlfriend, and then I go to sleep,
And yet I feel this dread.
As though this was never meant to happen.
I was supposed to die there, I can't stop myself from thinking.

The night the life I was supposed to live, the life I wanted, disappeared forever,
And now, everything is unhappy, unwanted, unfulfilling,
I wonder what difference it would make for me if I was dead,
I wonder when death will find me and reap the debt I was meant to pay months ago.

I find myself at that bridge often.
Staring at the water, wondering if I should dare satisfy my deep, inner longing
I walk away from the bridge, a husk longing to be freed from the mortal coil,
Cigarette in my mouth, a lighter in my hand,
I can only hope this will kill me soon
For every second, I wish I could leave my shackles behind,
And plunge into the cold, icy embrace of death, beneath the black water below.","1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0","happens,family",mixed,sadness,"institution,government,difference,humanity,employer"

"2025 December 1: Dear Diary,

I am not sure if I can consider these past eleven months to be a success or a failure. Sure, I definitely did a lot more reading than I have done in the past, but I have not done much writing outside of these entries. I have also not had many experiences worthy of writing about; most of these entries have been about my thoughts.  
  
There have been a lot of disappointments in these eleven months. A lot of it is all on me. Some of it is just how the world works. Disappointment does not have to be bad, I can take this as a learning experience. The most important thing I need to do is love and care for myself. That will be my resolution for the year, although I can start early.  
  
Just as 2025 was the year of reading 2026 will be the year of self love and care. When I show myself genuine care the rest of what I need will follow. I can not be loved if I do not believe I deserve to be loved. I can not write good stories if I do not believe my stories are any good. Taking care of myself will be essential and I will not be made to feel as if it is anything less than noble.  
  
Sincerely,

2025 was not gentle.
It came with teeth.
It came with shadows
that crawled into my bed
and whispered things
I didnt want to hear.

A friendship I carried for decades
rotted in my hands
before I realized it was already dead.

A husband I trusted
showed me a betrayal
so sharp it carved a hole
through the middle of my chest.

My daughter stepped into her teenage fire
moods swinging like doors in a storm,
and I stood in the doorway,
trying to keep myself together
while holding her world in place.

There were days
I walked into work
with a face that wasnt mine
a stitched-together mask
made of Im fine,
because the truth felt too heavy
to hand to anyone.

Some nights,
I fell asleep with my heart clenched
and woke up with the same ache
a reminder that even in my dreams
I couldnt outrun the truth.

But I am alive. I think thats good

"This is a part from my diary I wrote a few days ago. I never liked the idea of writing diary, let alone sharing it on the internet, but I am willing to try this. Animosity of internet also helps a lot in this case. I am still young, if anyone has felt like this or if yo have something to say, please reply. I am open to review.

  
""I don't know who I am, I don't know my own thoughts, I don't have much opinion on myself, I am so so unsure of myself. I can have any ideology I want, but I don't know what I want. I criticize myself, but if I want I could adore myself. I could support or hate anything I want, its as if I don't have a side, it is as if I am deciding if I will take this or that side. 

For example:

I feel so emotionally needy but at the same time emotionally dead and absent. I feel others' pain but I also can choose to not feel them. I love friends but I am not attached to them. I want vulnerability but I never will give it. I feel the need for a person but I also feel all powerful and like I don't want anyone. 

I get the emotions I want, I feel sad because I want to and because it burns me and I enjoy and romanticize the pain, I could feel better if I wished. I dont have emotions, I only make them up. I see myself as a third person, I am someone, I look at myself and think if I need to feel something. 

If someone were to become my best friend, as many have before, I would love them, but I also feel unattached, I could say goodbye at any instant, they are just a person I think that I am still me if they go. I only care about them because I think I should not because of love. 

Same with parents, they are closest to me and I have utmost care for them, but only because I believe it is my duty to care, I don't think that I have an actual connection. I am the only person I feel connected to.

Is it the same for everyone, or do people really actually feel Do people actually have emotions without forming them Do people actually love someone



Even after all this thought and I could argue with myself that it is not all true if I start to believe otherwise. If I decide that I want to feel and not make emotions, that would just make me stop thinking about my emotions, they would still be made up but just with less attention and then I would think that those are real emotions. What are emotions



Since my childhood, some of my deepest emotions are anger, vengeance and duty, but those three are also disconnected from me. I feel angry but I can sit and calmly think about my anger and why it is and I could decide to remove it or bring it back or increase it. I don't even have original anger.



I have written so much and I feel like I have wasted my precious time doing what dumb people do, talking about thoughts and emotions. ""

"She's been home doing god knows what, while I'm out spending time with the kids.

She said she was planning on organizing the garage today and maybe do some off-the-clock work which is very common for her to do even during the week.

Meanwhile I'm with the kids doing parenting and she apparently goes to sleep cuz she's tired from the past 2 days of activities, which really just consisted of going to her family's and my family for thanksgiving. But today I give her a restful day, even though she apparently didn't take advantage of not having anyone home to distract her. And apparently she didn't even get to do the physical work she said she would, and just did her work from home. She's always doing work from home, and I am always picking up the slack.

Today I was with the kids all day, she basically slept for 4 hours and that's not including the 7 hours we slept last night. I fed the kids, cleaned the house, kitchen and the kids rooms, all while she slept.

Now I'm wondering if I get some kind of reward for the hard work I put in maintaining a decent living. She never initiated intimacy so I will need to initiate LIKE ALWAYS, and who knows if I will get rejected AGAIN.

"I don't have therapy until Tuesday so I'm coming here to just get these feelings out. 

I hate Thanksgiving. Unless I'm spending the day alone it's a complete bad day for me. It's always been a bad day for me. What I'm about to describe below is the same crap I went through as a child. Now, I'm NC and much happier without the family that bullied me in my life. Unfortunately, I am required to spend the holiday with my neighbors just to ""keep the peace."" There's so much more to that and I don't want to get into the ""why"" of it all. Bottom line: my presence is mandatory and I haven't found a way to get out of it. 

This year, one of my neighbors constantly called me ""the heinous B-word"" because I am going to a live Bears game in a few weeks and was excited about my team doing well for once. It was pure jealousy and I know that. But, it doesn't mean that it doesn't hurt. 

Next, why am I taking a train instead of flying Because I haven't ever taken the train and I want to experience this mode of travel. ""Waste of money"" was the response until I explained that the train was cheaper than a flight. Que the eye roll.

When asked about my plans for Chicago the whole room united to tell me that my plans all the way down to what hotel I'm staying at were ""stupid"" and then they all started suggesting alternatives at once. A whole room of people shouting suggestions. I have no idea what anyone said, the cacophony of sound was a jumble of everyone talking at once and it made my brain ache.

For context, I'm staying at The Congress Hotel because it's supposedly haunted, has a ghoul and a vampire nest. I'm also going to the old Excalibur nightclub now Tao Chicago because of all of the creepy history, and I'm going to look for the mermaids at Navy Pier. 

When I told them that because I'm going by myself I am indulging in the things that interest ME and not the things that interest people who aren't coming on this trip. The response was ""your interests are dangerous and stupid. You're going to get killed and we're going to be mad at you if you never come back."" Yes, that bonkers statement really did come out of one of their faces. When she said that I was just as stunned as you. I think my jaw is still on her living room floor.

This conversation lasted a lot longer than it should've. It finally ended when I pointed out that ""vampires and mermaids"" aren't based in reality and I'm just going to historical buildings with interesting lore. 

Next, I'm apparently not watching the same documentaries as the rest of the house. They all have been watching this series about various wars that they apparently found super interesting. I haven't even heard of the series they were talking about and they admonished me for ""living under a rock."" I told them I usually watch documentaries about the ocean and that I am much more interested in nature than I am about the Revolutionary War. Some of these people have known me for over a decade and they know what my interests are. This wasn't news to them. I've been a scuba diver for 25 years and have a goal of opening my own dive shop that's designed to help people in therapy--they know this. 

These are just a few of the things that happened. Whenever they finished ganging up on me they all took time to say ""but we love you"" That's some BS right there. But, it messes with my head nonetheless. 

Growing up it was the same pattern: your interests are stupid, do this thing you're not interested in instead because we don't like the thing you like....but don't worry we love you ""nO mAtTeR wHAt.""

I dont even know which state Id want. Maybe Pennsylvania since I have a cousin there is she my cousin Im not actually sure. Or you know, definitely Oregon but thats not Eastern Time. Anyway, its past seven ante meridiem and Im still not sleeping. I dont even know if Im sleepy; I just know Ive got a headache.

Anyway, I skipped game night with my siblings last night, only for me to play APEX for hours on end. I didnt want to join them because I was already feeling a bit depressed, and I knew that if I joined and didnt get some sort of win, my mood would tank even further. So I made the executive choice to skip, watched a couple videos, took a nap Jee-zus I really am operating on EST, wrote some stuff, and then played APEX until a few minutes ago.

First of all, I just want to point out how much of a single-player bitch I am. I was grinding levels so I could unlock Gibby because I like him and because I feel like I can actually use him well enough to help my siblings when we play. I leveled up mostly through bot royale becausewell Im still too intimidated to play with real players online. Also, Im sorry, but I genuinely cannot, for the life of me, enjoy multiplayer gamesunless its Lethal Company or other slow-paced games. Wait, is that multiplayer or co-op I still cant tell the difference and yes, I could Google it, but I cant be bothered. The point is: Im really just not a fan of anything beyond single-player games.

And I realized this even more because I was objectively having fun with bot royale when it was just me and the bots.

Did I improve I cant really tell. It felt like it. I ramped up the bot difficulty, so that seems good. But well only know if I actually improved once I play a real match with my siblings. For now, I still have the reflexes of a potato, but this feels like a tiny winand Ill take it.

On another note, my mood has been fluctuating intensely lately, so I know Im heading into a couple of days where Ill probably go numb again. The multiple dreams, the delirious wake-upsI know the signs of me slipping into a depressive episode. And wowme calling it an episode when Im not diagnosed with anything. Honestly though I wouldnt be surprised if I eventually was. Ugh. I know I need to get myself checked. Definitely on the list for when I finally get my life together.

Anyway, whenever Im in one of these episodes, I end up watching a ton of horror movies or horror gameplays. I think thats why this year I finally learned to watch horror at all. The easily scared, easily startled bitch that I am barelybarelygets scared when Im in this depressive stupor. So I just make a point to watch horror to yank myself out of that emotional dead zone.

And I was thinking: the goal is to finish Outlast before the year ends. I still havent finished The Walking Dead, but Ill play Outlast first. The Walking Dead is too emotional, and when Im already running on empty well, God knows what would happen to me emotionally. So yeah, I might play Outlast soon. I can feel Im gonna need that chaos in the next few days.

I should really get some sleepor at least a nap. My sleep schedule is in a perpetual state of repair. I dont even know if I can sleep, though. I still smell chlorine or bleach or whatever from my parents bathroom. My sink plumbing needs to be fixed so I had to use theirs, and they left the cleaning chemicals in their bathroomto like, marinate the bathroom I dont know. I was inhaling fumes the entire time I was brushing my teeth and washing my face. Why did I stay in there No idea. I had no other place to do my hygiene routine. Sure, I couldve done it in the kitchen but whatever. Maybe thats why Ive had this headache. Anyway, why am I even rambling about this

"I wrote this about two years ago in a notebook.
Well, now I'm going to write the definition of love of life that is, when someone says that someone is the love of their life. Before, I thought that people said that when they were really sure that it was the only person they were going to love in their life, that it happened once in a lifetime, that is, it was a person in a lifetime. I'm right, you can also say that if it's possible and if it's real that it happens, I think it could happen, when you say ""you're the love of my life"" it's like you're saying that ""you're the person I'm going to love the most in my life.""
That love when you say you are the love of my life is like the name of that person when you tell a person the name of what you feel for them, the feeling.
Good is love, the strongest I have ever felt, the most important it has been in my entire life. But it is also true that it can be the love that at that moment in life, in that stage of life and that every time you have a relationship with someone, boyfriends, you tell them that they are the love of your life even though you have told it to other
Well, anyway, I prefer the first option, which is what I think is correct.","1,1,0,0,0,1","notebook,definition,relationship",positive,affection,"relationship,definition,moment,prefer,option"
"Me 34F, things are going so well in my life. Maybe not as good as other people's but my threshold for happiness is low by comparison. After trying nearly every kind of contraception, I've found my body reacts well to the depot injection which lasts 3 months before having to re inject. Unfortunately the side effect is weight gain, and through hunger that would succumb a person to cannibalism. I've been hungry before in my youth, my first relationship was abusive and food was used to control, so I know what hunger is. The hunger on this injection is different though.

Some time before this I had tried the implant in my arm, which caused borderline insanity at times, the weight gain on that was different. It wasn't hunger, I was just ballooning. Ofcourse when that came out I deflated to the weight I had been before it, a nice well rounded 162lbs over the course of 14 months. I had lost nearly 40lbs.

This new contraception though keeping me sane means I don't have periods though, I have some spotting but the hormones to tell me I'm on. The hunger is uncontrollable though and after putting on 20lbs despite exercise, a busy life etc, eating healthier than I have, I have put weight on.

Which led me to bite the bullet and make an appointment with a pharmacy that sell the miraculous weight loss injection. Thursday the 27th I had my first starting dose, with a nicely spoken pharmacist lady after a counsellation with her 3 weeks before. 3 weeks being long enough to change my mind, but I knew I was past the point of umming and ahhhing at this point.. I was desperate to not feel big again. My bones are not made for it.

I'm experiencing my period pangs, or mounjaro pangs. I can't tell what is what now. 

Yesterday, Saturday my thighs had the worst cramps, I was incredibly fatigued and I spent the evening on the sofa. I had even fallen asleep on my sofa, ordering take away for the kids for the 2nd day in a row and just grateful to the universe that I've got a few days off work. It didn't fall into my taking the mounjaro injection at the end of my last work day with 4 day break on purpose, it was some kind of luck. Its Sunday though now and while the fatigue has worn off a lot, since yesterday my breasts are hurting.

They are sore and full, not like my period soreness. They feel like I'm pregnant. I know this can't be possible, I'd have to have the worst luck with contraception in the world at this point. I am experience no nausea or vomiting symptoms from the mounjaro so I am lucky there and I am loading up on protein. Chicken and fish heavily the last few days. This morning I had a heavily buttered slice of toast. Before the moinjaro injection I was 177lbs  on the Thursday and on sunday now I am a pound and a half lighter. I am so worried about miunjaro breasts but have consoled myself with the fact that I can after all have surgeries for it in a couple of years, but this weight loss is a here and now. 

I'll continue to monitor, writing my weight and any changes to my body.

I thought I could exercise alongside mounjaro, however I am easily exhausted I think, as my body adjusts to the change of what is going in.

"The night was a quiet, trembling thing
a wavering breath of moonlight and shadow,
so still it felt the world was holding itself together
by the thinnest threads of hope.

And there you were,
your head against my chest,
your breath shallow
as if even the air had grown afraid to touch you.
I remember the warmth leaving slowly,
not suddenly,
not cruelly
but like someone dimming the lantern of my world
one notch at a time.

Your fingers curled around mine,
weak but willing,
and I could feel you fighting,
even when your eyes began to glaze
like misted glass.
I whispered your name
once, then again,
as if repeating it might anchor you
to this fading shore of life.

But your gaze drifted upward
to some place I couldnt follow,
to a horizon I could not see.

And when your lips parted,
your final breath slipped out
like a secret the universe
was reclaiming.

In that moment
the world broke quietly
not in thunder,
not in lightning,
but in a soft, unforgiving stillness
that hollowed me out
from the inside.

I felt your weight settle into my arms,
heavier in death than in life
as if your spirit had stepped away,
leaving me holding only the sorrow
you could no longer bear.

Time did not stop;
it turned cruelly onward,
dragging me with it.

But part of me stayed kneeling there,
frozen,
grasping the echo of a heartbeat
that no longer answered mine.

The years that followed
did not heal
they layered.

Grief stacked upon grief,
memory upon memory,
each one pressing down
like stones on a collapsing chest.

I carried your laughter
like a fragile relic,
your voice like a ghost
that lived between the beats of silence.
Every room I entered
felt missing one light,
one warmth,
one truth that once made it whole.

Nights stretched long and merciless,
and I learned the sound of loneliness
its low hum,
its patient ache,
its way of curling into the ribs
and refusing to leave.

Your absence sharpened everything:
my steps, my breath,
the space beside me that remained
forever untouched.

I searched the sky sometimes, 
wondering if you were hidden 
in the hush of the stars, 
in the thin silver of the moon, 
in the cold air that moved the leaves 
with fingers you once entwined with mine. 

But the heavens stayed silent, 
a thousand miles beyond reach, 
unwilling to answer 
why it chose to keep you 
and leave me with the ruin of longing. 

And still 
I walk with your memory 
stitched into my chest, 
threaded through every sorrowed beat. 
The weight has not lessened; 
I have only grown strong enough 
to bear it without breaking.  

Some days it feels gentler, 
a soft hand on my shoulder; 
other days it sinks inward, 
reminding me that love, once lost, 
etches itself into bone. 

But even in the darkest hours, 
I am grateful 
you were here long enough 
for me to know what it meant 
to hold something sacred 
to love someone so deeply 
that their leaving 
reshaped the architecture of my soul.

If grief is the price for love, 
I pay it still 
willingly, endlessly, 
carrying your final breath, 
your fading warmth, 
your silent weight 
against my heart. 

Forever held. 
Forever missed.
Forever mine to carry.

"I had a close online friend like we were really really close, and we planned to apply for a scholarship abroad together. I was hesitant because of family issues and limited money, but she kept saying, Well apply together, go together, and we even agreed on a timeline for next year.Then, out of nowhere, she sent me a photo from the consulate.
When I asked her where she was, she said, Visa interview. I was shocked, she had registered, got accepted, and went to the interview without telling me at all. If I hadnt asked, I would have had no idea.

The worst part
She was constantly crying to me about not having enough money, being stressed, and struggling. I tried to support her and hide my shock.
Also she loovedd complaining about her body, saying she was fat, comparing herself to idols, wishing she could change her face and body completely. Slowly, I started feeling insecurities I never had before.

A week before she left, I tried to meet her one last time to say goodbye. We agreed on a place and time. I changed my class schedule, even brought her a handmade gift but she didnt show.
She said she was asleep, but later I found out she was awake and getting ready for her trip not planning to meet me at all.

After that, I closed all my social media accounts, and only briefly reopened them to wish her well before closing them again.

Lately, I realize I was carrying a one-sided friendship, full of negativity that caused me insecurities I didnt have before.

Was our friendship really toxic
Or am I overreacting

"She's been home doing god knows what, while I'm out spending time with the kids.

She said she was planning on organizing the garage today and maybe do some off-the-clock work which is very common for her to do even during the week.

Meanwhile I'm with the kids doing parenting and she apparently goes to sleep cuz she's tired from the past 2 days of activities, which really just consisted of going to her family's and my family for thanksgiving. But today I give her a restful day, even though she apparently didn't take advantage of not having anyone home to distract her. And apparently she didn't even get to do the physical work she said she would, and just did her work from home. She's always doing work from home, and I am always picking up the slack.

Today I was with the kids all day, she basically slept for 4 hours and that's not including the 7 hours we slept last night. I fed the kids, cleaned the house, kitchen and the kids rooms, all while she slept.

Now I'm wondering if I get some kind of reward for the hard work I put in maintaining a decent living. She never initiated intimacy so I will need to initiate LIKE ALWAYS, and who knows if I will get rejected AGAIN.

Even with the therapy we are both getting, I don't know if I want this to be my life, especially into the ages where the kids are easier to manage and babysit.","1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,0","family,work,family,family,work,basically,dinner,work",neutral,none,"easier,never,apparently,activities,especially"

"2025 November 30: Dear Diary,

While usually found in people with OCD, intrusive thoughts can be found in Autistic people as well. I realize that I have been having thoughts that contradict my own beliefs all the time. This may be the biggest factor in why I am so paranoid all the time and loathe myself a lot.  
  
They were not always horrendous. Usually it would be that I got the thought to throw my phone out of a moving car on the highway. This caused me to always want the window closed so I could never accidentally do this. The thoughts have gotten a bit worse.  
  
At work I tend to get the thought that I have either done or will do something that will cause people discomfort. The very last thing I want to do is upset one of my coworkers, lately I have been apologizing for things they do not care about. Most recently I almost had a nervous breakdown because I had mouth stims near another coworker and I thought I was being creepy towards her. She also has Autism and was understanding. 

I also borrowed a DVD from a coworker yesterday and after watching it I returned it immediately because I knew he was still at work. I could have waited for today, but I did not know he was going to be in until after I returned the DVD. I wanted to be hasty because I had the thought that if I kept the DVD for too long I would break it, which I of course do not want to do.

I consider myself to be very grateful to have such understanding coworkers. They do not yet know that I have these intrusive thoughts, but they have been comforting and affirming that I am not doing anything upsetting. Still, my mind will have me believe this is all an act and they are just trying to be civil. Deep down I do know they are truly being compassionate, it is just hard to break a mental habit. The biggest problem is how I view myself. I must believe I am deserving of kindness.

What I need to remember most is to live in virtue. Maybe I am too worried about how my actions affect others. Worrying is not something I should do. All I need to do is to remember to live in virtue and it will be done.  
  
This is not something that requires effort. The Universe will guide my actions to be virtuous as long as that is my intention. I can feel the pull further towards virtue.

This morning as I was going to work I felt so nervous that I thought I would vomit. I had never worked on Black Friday before; this would be my first. As I was driving to work I was pleasantly surprised. There was barely any traffic and I found a parking space that was decent.  
  
I feel I have been connecting with my coworkers more. I even seem to be warming up to the ones I still have a few worries about. I did not get to talk much today due to how busy it was, but I am glad I still got to discuss somewhat.  
  
My mom and sister came into my work today. My boss saw my mom and told her that she raised the nicest person she met. My mom replied that she is somewhat worried about that because of how the world is to which my boss replied that she would be sure to keep me safe. I am very grateful for my boss and am glad that I truly can connect with people, despite my worries. Black Friday was busy, but not bad. Maybe I should just stop worrying and love life.

I had no idea what was happening.  I was completely out of it.  I was told that when the chopper delivered my body to the medical team, the doctor he was a Captain spent a good piece of time yelling at the people who'd loaded my body and called in the alert.

See, I was DED dead.  
The Captain was pissed because they'd wasted a bunch of supplies preparing for me.

  
Two doctors later, they were even more certain I was dead.  And when no more casualties came in, one of the doctors got around to setting up the autopsy.  I had no sensation.  I have no memory.  I wish I had.

  
Because, I am told, because I'd woken up as he was setting things up

It scare d the crap out of him, as I was told, and he fainted.

But I wasn't cognizant.

Fortunately, my father had been asking me if he could have his own smartphone and I ended up giving mine away. Although, his asking me made me do it, I'd always been wanting to get rid of it, and I guess that girl was a trigger point. My attention span was jacked, got addicted to silly things even no matter how much I'd been wanting to get rid of bad habits, phone-related bad habits. Finally, I thought, it'd not work that way. If I'd delete Instagram and the account, as long as I'd have access to play store, I'd download it and would continue using it.  
So, I'm technically 29 days down without a smartphone and it's finally bringing me some peace. Got into reading, which is something I'd always wanted to be into.  
It's the alcohol and smoking that's next on the line, I'm not addicted to smoking daily but it somehow fit into my schedule. I work night shifts, it's almost 4 in the morning when I have my breakfast and not lighting a cigaratte post my breakfast feels like something's missing, something like that.  
I've been doing great at work. My manager's impressed, apparently. Sometimes he exaggerates things which, I guess, isn't being liked by most of my teammates. Old me would not have stood this and it'd make me leave the job. However, I've been given many challenging responsibilities which I'd not get if I leave this job and join a new one with some good hike. Objectively, I shouldn't leave this at all. Last I worked, I was giving a feedback to a peer of mine, I'm an auditor, I audit chats handled by representatives, he made me put the call on hold for a moment and announced in front of everyone that I'm taking another responsibility. Which sounds good. It's probably because he didn't find anyone to take that responsibility and I just was one of the options.  
Last we got drunk, the manager and I, I'd told him and alcohol isn't that I'm into anymore. It's because, mostly, I'm hungover the very next day, puke a lot, and stuff like that. And he's now pissed that I'd not wanna touch alcohol anymore. I did say to him that I'd come and be there 100 of the time but that I wouldn't touch alcohol. This may affect the relationship, between him and I, this may affect my work life as well.  
I'm obidient, I never call in sick, don't take leave that much, I'm obidient. But whatever, it'd always be better if either of it happens, mine staying or not staying here.  
I guess I'd prepare some egg rice now.","1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0","english,work,instagram,dinner,apparently,would,obidient",mixed,none,"responsibility,relationship,attention,hungover,whatever"
"What a stupid little trap I still fall into.

Today he hurt me again 
and I felt that familiar sting,
the one I shouldve grown numb to by now,
but somehow, it still cuts.

Its almost pathetic how I still trust his words.
How I still let myself believe that maybe 
just maybe
this time hell mean what he says.
But he never does.
He never fking does.

One minute he gives me a glimpse of something warm,
something almost loving, almost normal,
and the next minute he snatches it away
like he enjoys watching my face drop.

Sometimes I swear he hates seeing me happy.
Like my happiness threatens the tiny illusion of power he clings to.
Like he cant stand the idea of me feeling light
while he stays dark.

I cried, but it wasnt the weak, 
begging cry I used to do.
Just a few quiet tears 
the kind you wipe off with a steady hand
because you already know the pain is predictable.
Expected.
Routine.

And still I let him have this power over me.
I hate that.
I hate how deep this attachment runs,
how twisted this trauma bond feels.
I hate that my body still reacts
to a man who doesnt even deserve a reaction.

But heres the truth:
Im growing in the shadows he created.
Not gracefully, not beautifully 
but Im growing like something wild and stubborn
that refuses to die.

Im not young anymore,
but Im not done.
Im not finished learning how to save myself.

Some days I tell myself 
Im not alone in this kind of cruelty 
that other women out there are sitting next to men
who smile while quietly breaking them.
And somehow that makes the loneliness hurt less.

Call it trauma, call it attachment, call it stupidity 
but one day, this bond will snap.
One day, my heart will close the door
that my fear keeps cracked open.

Not today.
But soon.
One day I will walk away
without shaking, without crying,
without looking back.

his own reflection.","1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1","stupid,familiar,health,today,reflection",positive,happiness,"attachment,loneliness,reflection,happiness,stupidity"

I was thinking about why it's hard for me to find peace within my own framework. The epistemological basis for my own philosophical paradigm is just the idea of subjective interpretation. The world exists as a relationship between the perceiver and the perception, not a relationship between objective metrics. Based on this fact, we can infer that, since everything is a perception instead of having an objective basis, that our understanding of the world will be colored by our interpretations. If our existence is defined by our individual perceptions of the world RATHER than by objective metrics, it stands to reason that our epistemology is fallible to our own biases. And therefore, if our existence can only be understood through our perspectives, and if actions are based upon our perspectives rather than something OUTSIDE of our experiences, our actions will fundamentally be contaminated by our perspectives.

In other words, if our actions depend entirely on our own perspectives, and our perspectives depend entirely on our subjective interpretation, Our actions depend entirely on our subjective interpretation. Any ""choice"" when making an action is therefore, similarly, is entirely dependent on our subjective interpretation. That is the basis for my epistemology. Any ""choice"" is just an inevitable subjective state that represents itself rather than a deliberate or objective decision making process.

And yet, we must hold people accountable. The truth is seemingly abundant in the world, and so are the judgements that extend from the truth. Human beings can exist optimally in a space, it's as easy as saying ""killing is bad."" And there are ways to prove it too Killing people causes problems, and that is undeniable given our proclivity to work better in groups and share information. Killing would certainly disrupt that process in most cases And everyone recognizes this, even me.

The people that are willing to judge others under moral premises are, under my framework, relying on their interpretation to justify their actions. The same way racist people, child rapists, and other horrible people are satisfied in using their interpretations. All actions: judging, raping, destroying, helping, loving. It's all contaminated by the subjective interpretation of reality. The basis AND justification is the same. People that are willing to judge others for the ""right"" reasons establishing laws, policing bad behavior are performing in the exact same way that people who judge others for the ""wrong"" reasons raping, killing. Which, ultimately, implies that it isn't the action itself that people have a problem with, but rather the consequence that extends from the action since everyone uses subjective interpretation.

And we arrive at the final conclusion. If everything is an interpretation, nothing is. The ontology what is real that extends from this epistemology our knowledge is useless because it states that you will do what satisfies your own perspective regardless of objective truth. And how does that, ontologically, stipulate your moral righteousness","1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0","framework,relationship,optimally,work",negative,none,"interpretation,justification,righteousness,relationship,information"

"I tried journaling again today.  
For maybe the 47th time in my life.  
And once again I stared at the blank page like it personally offended me.

The funny thing is: I like the idea of journaling.  
I like the better self-awareness, emotional growth, all those nice words people say.  
But after a long day, writing feels like trying to deadlift a refrigerator with my brain.

So tonight, out of pure frustration, I ended up talking out loud about my day  just muttering to myself like a confused NPC.  
And I noticed something strange: talking felt natural.  
Way easier than typing.  
Almost too easy.

Thats when the thought hit me:  
Okay, what if I just talk and something else turns it into a journal for me

Fast-forward through a couple of late nights, too much caffeine, and a moment where I accidentally shipped a build with my test password hard-coded yes, tragic, and now I have this little thing Ive been using myself  an AI that talks back while I vent about my day.

It listens, asks decent questions, sometimes even better ones than my friends, and then magically turns the whole conversation into a clean journal entry.  
It also shows my emotional patterns, which is helpful but occasionally alarming Why was I also stressed last Wednesday What was I doing last Wednesday.

Im sharing this here because:

1. Ive always liked reading other peoples diary struggles,
2. I figured Im probably not the only one whos bad at journaling but still wants to reflect,
3. and honestly Im curious  do other people also freeze when staring at a blank page

If anyones interested in trying the little tool Ive been using myself, DM me or leave a comment

  
But mostly, I just wanted to write this down ironically, in actual text instead of talking to the AI I built to avoid writing.

I tried going to the gym this morning to see if that would exhaust me enough... no luck. So honestly, I am just looking for a distraction while I try to get through the day.

Family and friends pointed out that given my lack of emotion and reaction that I must have seen it coming and that I should pick up and move on but in reality its because I dissociated the entire time and just went through the motions of what was needed to be done.

Because of past trauma I used to try to dissociate but in the last 3-4 years I feel like I dont have control over it anymore and in both extremes of emotions joy and sadness, it takes over and hours later Ill forget what happened. Not entirely, Ill know the gist of it, but details are gone. I dont remember what I said, what someone else said, if I smiled or hugged someone. For example, I was asked to be a bridesmaid at my brothers wedding and I dont remember the interaction at all. I went on a dream vacation a year ago and dont remember most of it, it feels like a dream. All I can remember is feeling the happiest Ive ever felt and then sadness that I probably wont feel that way ever again.

"I want to speak about my feelings exactly as they were, without trying to analyze them or put them in a frame.
I was hurt almost all the time - by every move he made, every look, every word he said to me or to anyone else. The way he looked at me, and the way he looked at everyone else. Every message he sent on WhatsApp, every story he told about himself, everything he loved and everything he didnt. His food choices, the thoughts inside his head that he never said. The way he spoke about people, about a story, about his work, about himself. His jokes hurt me. His  brief, reluctant touches hurt me.

I constantly felt like he was acting with me, like he didnt want to or - didnt know how - to be real with me. Every sweet thing he said sounded like empty flattery, and it hurt. I was living with an open wound that kept getting bigger, deeper, every minute. The only time I felt any relief was when he slipped out of my mind for a bit.

I was in a state of constant pain - anxiety. I kept watching his eyes, his body language, and they hurt me. I felt like he saw me as less than him - boring, small.
There were moments when I felt he resented me, like he believed I would end up in a life better than his, in a way that meant he would never matter. I used this feeling a lot. And it felt good and ugly at the same time - this evil kind of satisfaction that comforts you but still hurts, and leaves behind a heavy, depressing trace.

I hated everything I felt. I hated the prison I put myself in - my mind revolving around every detail of him, thinking only of him, and of the ideas he planted in me: that Im not smart, not beautiful, not enough. That everything and everyone around me is better than me.

I loved anyone he hated, and hated anyone he loved. I compare myself to him. It is the bitterness I feel right now - that stomach drop, the anxiety, the fear, the jealousy, the shrinking of my own worth, the anger, the silence, and the helplessness.

I was ashamed of myself - my voice, my words, my movements, my clothes, my appearance. My choices. The stories I rehearsed in my head so they might impress him somehow.
I thought too much before speaking, and the words came out fake. He would answer in fake tone. The whole conversation was fake.

Im trying to remember the moments when I felt close to him - they were so few. I used to comfort myself with them, and even inside them I felt fake.
I felt like I hated him.

When he slept.
When he woke up and stayed in bed scrolling on his phone - I felt rejected.
I was embarrassed when he woke up and found me awake.

I wished I could sleep again so I could wake up later and leave him with a better impression - like I stayed up late, like I had an interesting life.

I was always confused: is this my image of myself because of him, or because I wanted to be that person
I swear I dont know.
Truly, I dont know.

But I was deeply stuck, unable to escape, unable to understand.
And I didnt want to continue, and I didnt want to end it.

Right now, Im living on the hope inside me, not on anything about him.
I dont miss his voice or his words.
Im afraid of his voice and his words - theyll hurt me.
Im afraid of anything new about him, because everything hurts.
Everything that comes from his direction hurts me - him, and everyone he knows.

Im walking toward the unknown, and Im terrified.
But theres hope that whats coming might be better.

Whats behind me has no hope at all.
I dont want to go back to that prison again.
I dont want to live in it anymore.

"I watch everyone around me find the love of their lives. I see people being chosen, being obsessed over, being picked again and again even after they've hurt someone, even after they've caused trauma. Meanwhile, I'm here. The one who stays. The one who puts in effort. The one who consoles, who supports, who shows up. And I'm never the one being chosen.

I'm so tired of hearing it: ""You'll find someone soon. You're still young. You'll find a better girl who's going to be obsessed with you."" I don't want to hear it anymore. Those words have lost all meaning. They feel like empty promises people say to make me feel better, not because they're true.

I used to believe in keeping your heart open even after getting hurt. I genuinely thought that if you stayed open amd kind, the right people would find you. That they'd see your heart and choose to enter it. But now, I don't think the right people even exist. I've lost hope of meeting someone like-minded, someone who's like a carbon copy of me, my female version, someone who just gets it.

And the cruelest part The people who don't even care about finding love, they find it so effortlessly. They stumble into it without even trying. Meanwhile, I'm the one who craves it, who wants it, who needs it, and I get nothing. I hate this stupid craving. I hate this constant wanting. It feels like punishment.

" On Time and My Weird Relationship With It

I keep feeling like I never have enough time, like the hours in a day are never enough. Which is ridiculous when I think about it, because its not like Im working or following some rigid structure. If anything, I technically have all the time in the worldat least if I live one day at a time. In the grand scheme of things Shit, I dont know. Maybe I am already too late for everything.

I know I should be doing something productivelooking for a job, learning new skills, fixing my finances, trying not to be a bitch or a spoiled brat about it. Whatever. The usual lectures I give myself. But I also feel like I never really let myself rest. Rest in a way that actually touches the parts of me that feel soul-tired. Rest in a way that gives relief, not guilt.

Whenever I try to rest, I somehow end up feeling like theres still not enough time. Which is insane because I have so much fucking time. Im gaming, watching Stranger Things and other shows, trying out shows Luisito suggested, answering messages from friends, writing journals, playing with creative writingnone of these exist inside a structured schedule. I dont even have a routine. I have absolute freedom. And yet I feel like Im constantly running out of hours. How the hell is that even possible

Im not working. Im not waking up early for shifts. Im not balancing anything heavy. So why do I move like someone being chased by a clock And can you imagine how chaotic itll be once I am working again With work-schedule exhaustion on top of everything else, how would I even fit gaming, shows, writing, and the rest of the things that make me feel alive

Maybe thats the point. Maybe this exhaustion Im dragging around is exactly what makes me feel like time slips too fast. Because when your soul is tired, even rest feels like a chore, and even joy feels like something you have to schedule.

So yeah. How the fuck do you heal a soul-tired How do you rest something that doesnt feel like it gets rest from sleep, fun, or distraction

I dont know. But Im sitting with the question.



 Jenny, and Indebtedness

Jenny messaged me today. For the past few days shed been texting me about the BLACKPINK concerthow happy she was, how she danced to every song, how she felt carefree for the first time in a while. And I was genuinely happy for her. She went alone, but she enjoyed herself. Just that alone is already a win for her.

Tonight, though, she shifted back to venting about her girl problems. She brought up her situation with Cath again. And my god younger people can be so exhausting.

Jenny clings to Cath the same way she used to cling to me.

Obsessively.

Intensely.

Blindly loyal.

And that same intensity is why shes drowning in mixed signals right now.

I get it. As a recovering people-pleaser, Ive been there. Ive clung to someone just because they threw me crumbs of affection. Ive confused attention with connection. But with what little energy I have left these days That is absolutely not for me anymore. Its still a work in progress, but I actually understand my worth now. And if someone gives me mixed signals or doesnt match my effortwhether platonic or romanticIm letting them go at a drop of a hat.

Jennys at that age where everything is loud, everything feels black-and-white, and every emotion feels like a moral battle. Shes in that era where If I did something nice, I deserve reciprocity feels like law. Maybe Im not explaining this perfectly, but the whole thing just tires me. I no longer have the patience for situationships, emotional confusion, or wasted time. If someone doesnt meet me where I am, I simply move on. Maybe thats why I have fewer friends now. Honestly Probably. And Im okay with that.

But heres the part I didnt want to admit:

Theres still this thin thread of indebtedness I feel toward her. Not because she deserves it, and not because I owe her anything. Its more like she was there during the most messed-up, unraveling part of my life. When I disappeared, she fought for me harder than I fought for myself. She didnt give up on me when I had already given up on everything.

How do you erase that

You dont.

But you also dont let it dictate your boundaries.

And thats the tension I keep sitting with.

Watching her obsess over Cath irritates me because it reminds me of who I used to bethe girl who tolerated emotional ambiguity, who overthought every message, who accepted crumbs, who mistook chaos for connection.

Im not that girl anymore. Or at least, I try to not to be.

And I will never be her again.

If anything, now, when I dont like someones energy, I leave. Still not the best habitI know I need to improve communicationbut its still progress. At least I no longer let people consume me.

But seeing Jenny stuck in the same loop makes me want to shake her and makes me step back. I know that cycle. I survived that cycle. Im not going back there.

Maybe thats why her situation stingsits not projection, its pattern recognition. Its watching someone drown in a cycle I fought like hell to escape.

The truth is, I appreciate Jenny. I always have. I appreciate the timing, the weird intensity, the iMessage novella era, her devotion, her chaos, all of it. But appreciation isnt obligation. And kindness doesnt mean I have to carry her emotional baggage for her.

And maybe Ive validated her feelings too much, to the point where she expects that comfort from me automatically. Which is sweet but also draining. And maybe I need to have that uncomfortable conversation and set a real boundary.

I just dont feel like having that awkward talk right now. Shes stubborn. Im stubborn. We still argue sometimes, and that youthful need-to-win energy is just too much for me these days.

Ill deal with her tomorrow.","1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1","relationship,ridiculous,indebtedness,tomorrow",positive,happiness,"effortwhether,relationship,indebtedness,appreciation,conversation"

We had a good run yknow Us I mean, well also me and my ex but Im talking about all of us here in my noggin. Wasnt perfect but it was fun. Or at least the most of it. You know, I never really got the whole friend thing, I mean I guess it could just be the introverted stuff and the selective mutism. But hey at least I got picked up by some people for a while. 

Man, were gonna miss gta 6, to be fair I wasnt gonna play it anyway but I guess its funny, maybe one of us wouldve. Its weird that knowing this stuff now Im happier. Theres some people Im gonna miss, Ill probably have to start figuring out something for that since Id prefer to give them all closure. I mean, technically I could just let go of control but I think even if someone took my place theyd not last long, I mean, look at me. I was created literally so this wouldnt happen. Now Im back where she was. Ig I should give the others time to experience life for themselves before I get rid of that chance for us. I guess its time for us to have a talk about when this is happening again. First plan was for it to be around our 21st birthday. You know, spend a week or three giving everyone a day or two to experience life, do things they want. Then its all done, we get together with all our favorite things and fade away like all things do.

"Me 37m have been in countless meaningless relationships. The only one that had any potential was when I was 16 and my girlfriend was 31, we have an 18 year old son who recently just graduated out of high school. Now Im living in Iowa going through the most unnecessary bs, why Because I try to see the good in everyone. Ive been lied on, put in jail, and have been subjected to constant down talk. By who you ask The mother of 2 of my kids. If she gets loud while talking its fine, but if I get loud when Im talking, Im doing too much. Then I get put on the blocklist like I am right now and dont know what I said or did and when I ask her to explain to me why shes mad at me Im met with silence. No response to any of my texts which I dont for the life of me understand why. WE HAVE TWO KIDS TOGETHER STOP BLOCKING ME Then not explaining what it is that has you upset isnt good for my depression. My pride hurts more than anything because Ive literally forgiven her for sending me to jail, but she still has the same attitudementality which is the cause of our disputes. When are you gonna grow up and stop using my kids as chess pieces When will you see that the reason you have 4 baby daddies is because of your nasty unchanged attitude and behavior. Im crying on the inside but nobody knows. Im contemplating on moving into the spiritual realm. Im sick of this body being subjected to the negative behaviors of people who dont see that they are the problem. Im tired of hurting because I cant see my kids, it literally hurts my heart. Ive given people chance after chance after chance. Thats the Sagittarius in me, but on the same side of that Im tired of people taking the energy and time I put into trying to appease them and just totally disregarding them, like Im gonna be around forever. Well Im sorry to inform the people whove constantly hurt me, I wont I promise you that. If something doesnt give before my birthday next Wednesday. I wont be around on Thursday. That will be the day that I make my transition into the spiritual realm. Im tired. Im hurt. Im exhausted. Im numb.

"I thought we were falling in love. The way he touched me, the way he spoke to me. Taking me to meet his family. Begging to watch my dog for me. The way he praised my touch and my kiss. The way he wanted to defend me from my ex. The way he cared for me. All felt real. All felt like love. 

Now, I wonder, not exactly, if he was pretending, but if he just didn't know what he was doing. If he didn't know what signals he was sending off. Because he sometimes doesn't. For example, when he took me to meet his family at his nephew's birthday party, he didn't understand that that would seem like a big deal to anybody else. You brought a girl you've been seeing for four months, and everybody in your family knows you've been spending almost every weekend at each other's houses, to a family birthday party. And you didn't think that that was serious You thought that was the same thing as bringing one of your school friends over You tell the girl you're fucking that you love her every time before you hang up the phone and you don't think she's going to think you mean romantic love 

That math is not mathing, and I'm angry again. And then I miss him, and I'm sad again. And I feel fooled. But I don't really think I did anything foolish. 

Anyway I was falling in love. I don't know what he was doing. I like to think he didn't know either.

"Dear diary, 

the time is nigh and 24 hours have almost come to pass. I have to get this out now, before I forget. 

Last night, in the witching hour I had a vision. I found myself wandering through a dense forest, with no compass or map and only the North Star to guide me. If it werent for the Moons glow, illuminating my path, I would not have been able to see. I continued to wander curiously, and eventually found myself standing in a clearing. I took in my surroundings - the lush greenery, tall evergreen trees. Flowers respirating, awaiting another day and still vibrant all the same. Even in the heart of night, and I

Suddenly, out of nowhere a mirror appeared before me and beckoned me to it. Without question, I complied. It asked me to look into it. Without question, I complied. It asked me, What do you see 

Oh, when I looked into the mirror it was me whod Id seen. But not me, the other me. I asked the mirror, What does this mean 

To which the mirror replied, It means that you are exactly where you need to be.

The present moment: Direction  
My rough draft, its exactly that. There is no need to deconstruct or destroy it - refinement and revisions can be made as the story continues to unfold. There is no right or wrong way to approach this. I am the author, after all. It does not have to be perfect, it just has to beme. That being said, I am committed to my story beginning and ending, with happiness. Rather than trying to start over from the very beginning, Ill pick the story up where it left off:

"There she was, perched in her corner of the cafe like a modern-day sphinx with a cappuccino. Her world was a book, and whatever was on the page was making her laugh in these short, tiny burstsa sound that made her scrunch her nose in a way that seemed to delight even her.

But the main event wasn't the coffee or the comedy. It was the Bag.

A deep, cavernous tote sat beside her. Earlier, Id been treated to a preview of its contents: a lip balm, a rattle of mints, a folded umbrella, and a tiny wallet had all made brief, dramatic appearances. It was a magic rugsack, and each time she plunged a hand in, I held my breath wondering what shed pull from its dimensional depths. How much did that thing weigh What sacred algorithm decided what made the cut each morning A pack of gum, but not a hairbrush An umbrella, but apparently, a deep sense of existential uncertainty

The moment of truth arrived. A purposeful dig. Aha Her phone. Mission accomplished.

Or so I thought.

Suddenly, the entire ecosystem of the table was in flux. It was time to go. Out came another, smaller bag a pouch A bag for the bag The plot thickens. The pen was evicted from the tabletop, the lip balm returned to the mothership, the hilarious book sealed shut. It was a tactical packing operation, each item slotted into a specific, unknowable quadrant.

Finally, she stood, hoisting the bag and wielding her umbrella not like a simple rain-guard, but like a warrior hefting a shield. She was armed for the battlefield of the outside world. She turned, ran a mental checklist, and her eyes widened. A final, decisive toss of the mint box into the abyss.

But wait.

A thought struck her. A terrible, forgotten thought. The pre-departure calm shattered. More digging. Furious digging. The book came back out. The pouch. A sanitizer bottle. I could see the panic setting in, a quiet storm on her face. Pockets were patted. No luck. A frantic glance under the table, then back to the bag, her arm submerged to the elbow. This was a full-blown archaeological crisis.

Then, a look of pure, unadulterated relief. From the depths, she produced her keys. The car keys. The holy grail.

With a sigh that I felt from across the room, everything was unceremoniously shoved back in. The ecosystem was restored, however chaotically.

I shook my head in sheer disbelief as she marched for the door, a warrior who had, against all odds, found her sword just in time for battle.","1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0","cappuccino,existential,thickens",positive,calmness,"mothership,operation,sanitizer,whatever,earlier"

"I dont know exactly how should I talk about this or with whom, and its been on my mind from the last few days so Ill just write the whole story here hoping I could get some answers. I feel like I have been unknowingly harassing someone and now Im constantly guilty and ashamed because of it.

Context: I go to a bank almost everyday as I have to make deposits for the company where I work and also I have my own business account with them so now almost all the staff knows me quite well. To an extent where theyd do my stuff without requiring id if they needed to. Theres one CSR who joined there only like a few months back so she would always be working at the front counters and thus Id see her 3-4 times each week. Conversations started from Hi, how are you and slowly we started talking about almost everything going on in our lives. Our likes, dislikes, hobbies and everything else. At first I thought this is only because its her job to communicate with the customers and maybe thats all shes doing but when we started having longer conversations I was like maybe I should ask her if shes okay being friends outside as well as I really loved her vibe. So I asked this thing to her and I was like only if you feel comfortable to which is said ya its totally fine and she gave me her personal phn number so I texted her later that day but we couldnt chat much because of our opposing schedules. But wed talk more and more whenever I used to visit the bank like even if some other person is helping me with the deposits she would still come and talk to me. So one day I texted her just a random hi but she didnt reply and i asked her the next day she said that she talked about this to one of her coworkers and they said maybe its not a good idea being too close with a client as banks often discourage this. After that I texted her okay maybe I understand what you are saying but can we meet for a coffee after work and she didnt respond to that text either. A couple days later, when I went to the bank, one of the other employees came up to me and asked that he wanted to talk to me about something this guy knew me more than all others at the bank as he handles my personal investments and all as well and we have been friends for more than a year now Even before who said anything, I could already sense this but he said that he wanted to talk about that whole situation as she said she doesnt want to get involved in this matter and at one point wanted to escalate this to the manager too. He told me that he understands maybe my intentions werent wrong and this whole situation became a bit exaggerated but its best if we put this to rest right here. I just replied yes okay and came back to work. Since then, I have been thinking about this and now I feel maybe I misunderstood the cues and she was actually trying to give me signals that I should stop but it was ignorant of me. So after this whole situation I tried to avoid going to the bank as much as I could and didnt see her for like 2 weeks and I have stopped talking to anyone at the bank now because I am too ashamed to kinda look in their eyes. Today I had to go make the deposits again and it was only her working at the front so she said hi and when I got to the counter she did ask how are you hows everything to which I just nodded and asked back then I started using my phone to avoid the conversation and to avoid even looking at her because I didnt want her to think if Im staring at her or anything. I dont know if I could have avoided this whole situation or maybe I just dont know","1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0","exactly,work,understands,work,conversation",positive,affection,"conversation,situation,business,whenever,manager"

"Sonya broke up with me last night and I was already having a tough time because I didn't eat before I gave blood and then walked all kinds so my own fault but idk if it was because I only quickly glanced at the message or because I wasn't really feeling well, but as soon as I got home and read the full thing still, I was kind of bummed but not as sad as I think anyone would have been. Idk if it's because I am so used to compartmentalizing negative feelings, I guess what I am saying is that I acknowledged the shittyness of it but never really let it come thru more than that. It makes me confused on if that's the way I should handle this one. Today I was just feeling already like I didn't want to really be at the dinner thing one too many people but that actually turned out to be ok we did have a good class. Ever since this move, I just been feeling off, like flopping back and forth between being flustered and just keeping my head down. I am quickly trying to make the moves I need to get out of here but do it on a good footing. 6 months a year, I am prepared for that I just can't let this fluster me though at least not now maybe later I can reflect on the frustration but that's not going to benefit me in any meaningful way. I think this could be some of the reason why Sonya moved on and I don't blame her I am not upset at her in any way I just wish I was different. You know to be honest it made me think deep down maybe this is karma just playing out I used to be so mean and when I was growing up, I just pled to myself to live like that. After finding the other side, Peace Love Unity Respect, and finding that it suited my values more I have tried so hard to make it a point to keep these principals forefront, but no matter how much I try and want and put it forth. I seem to continue to dwindle into such loneliness. It is positive that I have made some good friends in recovery but even that for some reason seems to fade back into a lonely place. In no way do I feel at risk of relapsing but the memories of just letting life just take me in the wind and just living for today has really been crossing my mind. I guess it because with this housing situation I just feel like now I am focused on writing this new part of my life and I don't have much time, so I got to get this right, Pressure. It's just hard to write because I know I can end this uncomfortable situation really quick, but I will have to go back to continuing to write my story doing things that are either one not good for my long-term health or two risky to my freedomliberty.

This is how you are supposed to be treated when you're in love, this must be the universes gift for the things I have been through. Playfulness, sparks, feeling safe with being open and honest. Feeling loved.

Things happened, things changed. When they did I was assured many times it was not me, it was somebody getting in his head. I believed him.

After everything, I continued to be open and honest. I was a little gaurded because of the hurt he caused me and the hurt I caused myself with my own actions. He promised from the beginning my vulnerability was safe with him. It wasn't. He already shattered me to pieces once, I should have known better. He used the open wound I was still recovering from to degrade me, in more ways than one. An argument we had, he viciously told me what he thought of me. I told him I craved the feeling of love I knew or thought he had for me, I was refused that love, that softness. 

The last time we were intimate. I remember it so vividly. I wonder if he does, if it is something he thinks of with remorse or with pride. I thought I knew him, I don't think I ever really did now. The way it started with soft kisses, pulling me in close, the way he kissed my neck and would inhale and that low sexy growl. Getting started, what is usually foreplay ""If you keep doing that I'm going to cum. I know you want to get fucked, don't you"". No, I didn't want fucked. I wanted him to make love to me, to finish the way he started. After he said that, I remembered the words he said a few weeks piror. He knew what I wanted, what I needed. I left the choice to him to stop me, he didn't. When he finished, we curled up cuddled on the couch. I cried, silently. Not making a sound as I did, something I learned to do from previous failed relationships. I felt used, I was used, I was just flesh like so many others. Now the words that keep replaying in my head ""I would never fuck a prostitute like that"". Still even though time has passed, those words lingered. Bringing more tears to fall.

My parents keep asking if Ive found someone, but I havent met any real prospects. Between my heavy workload and mounting responsibilities, Ive lost the patience and energy to go on dates.

Everyone wants to lecture me about what I should domy parents, my managers, everyone. It feels like I only exist to serve other peoples expectations.

 No Space to Be Myself

I posted some Instagram stories recently hanging out with friends, having drinks and smoking. Even my friends told me I shouldnt post things like that. I cant even express myself freely anymore.

My parents tell me to focus on the right things, yet in the same breath they compare my salary to their friends sons and say mine is too low. They lecture me about losing weight and taking care of my well-being.

 Being Used and Exploited

After work, Im lonely. My manager seems aware of this and uses it to pile more work on me.

Everyone around me is trying to lecture me or exploit me for what they want or what they think is right. Its frustrating.

 The Dating Landscape Is a Mess

The women Ive met so far havent been right either. One wanted me to move to a different city with her permanently. Another was addicted to weed and sugar, and already looked older than me. One got drunk and told me shed slept with 41 people, then wanted me to marry her.

Even my married friends are now getting divorced. Its all confusing.

At the office, a junior colleague hit on me once, but shes not my type. And a senior woman got attached to me without me even trying.

"So this has been bugging me for like more than a year and i need to know what do so i need everyone's opinion especially the ladies.  
So i had this friend who was more than a friend but we were not dating. We were so close and could text for hours especially at night from 6pm to around 2 or 3 am. Then I went and jinxed things up and now i think she hated he. Her grandmom passed away and me being an idiot said something which was not too good for her and i think it hurt her so i said myself as a threat and abandoned her cause i was scared of ever hurting her but she begged me and I didn't listen and we agreed for things to end. But i literally broke myself from that day. That must have hurt her more. So like a year passed and she like dated someone and broke up and she was like over me but it's now like 2 and a half years and i'm not over her. so we tried to be just friends but it didn't work. and like she doesn't want to talk to me but i wanna talk to her cause a told someone at school and he gave me some good advice that there is no way a relationship can be perfect and flaws may come. And that's when i realized i fucked up so bad, i felt way worse... Well i'm here now

"2025 November 26: Dear Diary,

I must be honest, oh dear reader, I have recognized that a lot of my problems stem from an intense subconscious self-loathing. There is no real reason why I should hate myself, but this is what the problem seems to be. My best guess is that I do not live up to the standard I have set for myself. I do not feel that I am good enough at anything and I feel that people think the same about me.   
  
There is no evidence of this. All I do is imagine people betraying me and talking behind my back. No, there is no evidence of any of that, only paranoia. The paranoia only happens because of my self-loathing, which I have no need for. I must believe that I am worthy of love and respect and give it to myself. I must allow myself to just be in the moment.  
  
There are so many Torinicos I love and yet I feel as though I cannot connect with them. My subconscious mind will find any excuse to find evidence that people hate me while my conscious mind knows I am good enough. The only Torinico I do not like is the one that thinks they have to be perfect in order to fit in. All of the others are so loveable and it is not fair that they hate themself.  
  
I should focus on my creative work and less about fitting in. It really does not matter if people do not think I am good enough. They most likely do not believe that anyway. All I have to do is give myself the care I deserve and most of my problems will fade right there. Putting myself second only hurts myself and others, so it is something I should abandon.  
  
Sincerely,  
  
The Self Aware Torinico","1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0","subconscious,believe,myself,torinicos,work",positive,affection,"november,evidence,reader,moment,matter"
"I guess there's not any hope. I gueed u did move on. I guess I never really meant all that much to like you did to me. Feels like maybe I was in a one sided relashionship but why did they tell me I was the first man to truly make them feel seen and loved. I'm destroyed I feel so low and abandoned.  How were all their ex use and play them. Am I this toxic and broken that me loving you put me below all those people. I see a theme. I'm everybody's last at the end man of the day. But the start they tell me how I'm the one they dididnt know could exist. It's all just lies... I feel hard into the floor. I envisioned being told I love you while holding you and caressing your hands and forearms. But I was insulted and thrown away in the same conversation I was told they loved me the first time.

"B threw me off my game in the best of ways. He became my new routine in no time at all. The center of my weekend plans. The first and last voice I heard most days. Texting constantly. Checking in at lunch break. Calling him on my way home. It was such a contrast to the way my ex-husband had ignored my messages and curved my phone calls. B made me feel cared for and connected. Called me 5 times a day sometimes, like prayers, to hear my voice, to tell me something funny, to say he missed me. So the new silence these past two days is noticeable. 

I try not to replay memories. But certain things just keep floating to the surface in my mind. His big, dark, serious eyes when he told me on our third or fourth day, ""We both know what this is, and where we're going."" Laughing naked at stupid movies in bed and brushing oil into his hair. Him bringing me a glass of cold water and a multivitamin in the morning with a forehead kiss. Feeling more free and loved and myself than I ever remember. The way he slid into me in the dark like our bodies were formed to fit together. The voice in my heart that growled, ""Mine"" the last time he laid his his head on my chest and sighed into my skin. And how touching that feeling felt like a live wire; how fast I mentally backed away and told myself, NO. 

He has a favorite coffee cup in my cupboard, he called my bed ""ours,"" and referred to his side. He has a toothbrush in my bathroom.

Yesterday I cleaned out my fridge like I do every week, and it happened to be time to throw out all the things we had bought last time he was here. Then the peach jalapeo jam from July and ""Good Luck, Babe"" on the Spotify stole my breath. I had to turn the music off and sit down while the spike of pain from my stomach up into my throat receded. I want to laugh at myself, but it still hurts too much. 

Room by room, I gathered up all the odds and ends he'd left scattered around my house over the past 5 months: a beard comb, a band t-shirt, some socks, a charcuterie platter. I kept the souvenir he brought me from the big concert he was so excited about. I made a mental note to ask him for my house key back. When I asked him when I could drop off his things, he ignored the question and instead sent  me a picture of the pie he baked for Thanksgiving. I like to think that means something. That it hurts him, too.","1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0","threw,family,multivitamin,remember,yesterday,health",positive,excitement,"remember,together,question,silence,platter"

"I F21 am trying to fall asleep while listening to my boyfriend snore over the phone were long-distance and my mind wont stop replaying things. I have an upcoming flight in December, and Im already queasy about possibly seeing his sister. We dont have the friendliest relationship.

All I can think about is the time we all went to Top Golf as a family my boyfriend, me, his brother, sister, and dad. When the afternoon wrapped up, we wanted to take a family photo, and she had the nerve to say she wanted another picture but without me. Who even says that And me, being a shy people pleaser, just let it happen. Ive never felt so excluded. She barely acknowledged me, didnt say hello, and made almost no effort to talk to me.

Then another memory came up the very first time I met her. We stopped by her house for a quick introduction. I was dressed modestly: a black floral shirt, jeans, and high heels. I like wearing heels because Im only 4'11"", and people often mistake me for being 1617. Heels make me feel feminine and more confident about my height. But a few minutes into meeting me, she pulled my boyfriend aside and whispered for him to be careful. Like what I had just met her, and she was already being bold and judgmental. If I ever acted that rude, my mom wouldve slapped me into the next millennium. I was raised to be polite, and it was literally just a quick hello there wasnt even enough time for me to accidentally offend her.

And then theres his mom, who once asked if we met on OnlyFans. Yes, my boyfriend was honest with me about his past porn addiction and how his parents found out about how much he spent on OnlyFans and Fansly but that is NOT a reason to assume Im one of those women.

Im just so frustrated with the way his family treats me. I vented my frustration about his sister to bf and he said he was sorry he didn't argue or fight me it felt really genuine","1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0","boyfriend,family,relationship,family,introduction,work,millennium",negative,frustration,"relationship,introduction,frustration,addiction,distance"

"Im 45 M yes Im old. Anyway I woke up today with a pretty bad headache. I figured I just didnt get enough sleep so I slept another hour. When I woke up I saw sweating a bit and my headache was still there and pounding. Also the slight smell of sweat made me nauseous so I took a shower which was difficult but was quick to kill the smell. 

Getting ready to leave the washroom I realized the nausea getting worse. So I leaned over the toilet and puked. Then slept a few more hours. 

I woke up again in pain and called into work to say I wasnt coming in the pain was to intense. Almost as soon as I did everything needed I grabbed an ibuprofen and gravol. I was about to take them but felt the nausea increase and puked again. Then I took the pills.  Then slept again for 4 or 5 hours. I slept most of the rest of the day and night waking here and there. Ive been awake now for about an hour and a half and the headache is still there but has subsided a lot.

I realize Id rather have a cold or flu compared to a migraine. Sure I feel bad but with a migraine I just want to die to end the pain.

"Ive come to conclusion that it may just be limerence. That its actually not love I feel for you even though I think it could be. We wont ever get together, Im not even your type of woman. Ive idealised you and everything surrounding you. I crave you, I yearn and long for you. But still, you dont see me the way I see you. And it breaks my a little, because I wish you would. I cant have you and I guess you wouldnt even want me. You are like a drug to me, I think about you all day, wondering if you miss me, wondering if you think about me too.

And I cant do this anymore. I break my own heart by waiting, by adoring you silently. Were just coworkers, just friends. I dont know what happened to me to feel this sort of strong emotions for you. Maybe its because you were there in the most soul crushing time of my life, maybe because you actually listened to me. Maybe because of the attention you gave me.

I have to let you go. I cant keep loving a ghost. And I wish I could tell you about it. I wish I could show you all the things i wanted us to be. Still want us to be. But these feelings arent mutual. I sit alone with them, quietly, hoping, almost begging you for your love.

Thats not how it works. Not how its supposed to be. I wouldnt even make you happy. And I want to see you shine, to see you happy. But I must accept that it wont be possible for me to be that person for you. Id probably break your heart like I break my own. I still fight my battles. I still am not okay emotionally. And even if we ever could get the chance to be something, I want it to be true, genuine and healthy. Thats not what I could offer you right now. You deserve someone who loves you loudly, not like me. Someone who will make you happy, and is not unhealthy obsessed over you like me.

Ive had to stop myself so many times to not text you in the middle of the night. To not tell you that I love you. To not tell you that I woke up crying because Ive dreamt about you and missed you after I woke up. And what would you even say if I told you all this

I was weak today.. I didnt mean to text you that much. Thats why I havent texted you yesterday too. Because I am scared. Im scared that its all not true, that Im alone with it, scared that its Limerence. When I told you I miss you, just know I meant it. I miss you all day.

I dont think Living is worth all the work I have to do for it, if I have to spend like a third of my life just working to survive with small pleasures in between I dont see the point in living at all, some people say the work is what makes it worth it and I sorts get that even if I dont agree but you dont only work for the things you want, you have to work for EVERYTHING and it sucks.

There no decent way out of it either, I have racked my brain for ways out that aren't just dieing and there are none, zero, zilch. There are easier ways but they aren't guaranteed either. As many choices as I have on what to do with my life they all just boil down to the same thing, work.

"2025 November 25: Dear Diary,

Petra has returned home for Thanksgiving break. It is strange to think that my sister has not been home for a few months. As soon as she got home I had to go to a hair appointment so we did not talk for long.  
  
At the hair appointment I got to talking with the hairdresser. We talked about reading and camping which was nice. We both feel that there is something spiritual about nature. Her kids are apparently very creative. It was very nice to have a decent conversation with somebody. Maybe it is just me growing up, but I feel I am able to be more genuine now.

"Alot can happen in a year. This time last year I was with the person I saw forever with. 10 years together, the days flew by. We got sober together, had our child, worked, and became a family. Yet somewhere along the way life happened and we just started existing instead of really seeing each other. I wanted it to work, God knows I did. I begged, I cried, I lost all self respect. At some point I finally chose me...just barely, but it happened, and continues to happen each day. 

I left the house we shared, the car, most of mine and the kids belongings and I started over. I didn't know what it would look like, but I knew it wouldn't look like me sitting there, being content with him seeing a co worker. 
Leaving was and is one of the hardest decisions I ever made. I left my job and the only friends I had. I moved into my mom's, no car, new job, new school for the kids.. 2 kids, one adult and all of our stuff in one bedroom. But slowly I'm picking up the pieces. I got a car immediately, I had to get back and forth to work and our daughter to her apts. I made new friends at my new job people I can't replace, and i finally got approved for my place. 
The crazy thing is I kept going, even through the tears, oh my... the days were tough. I've cried to my therapist so much. I've sat in bed for hours after everyone is asleep, tears rolling down my face.  I was crying today and begged God for some relief on the way home from work and when I got home I got the call about my place

There are so many days I wanted to give up, and one day I almost did.. it would have been easier, but I have to keep telling myself ""it's a bad day, not a bad life"" even when majority of the days were bad. 
I'm finding myself little by little and I'm not where I want to be, but I'm better than where I was yesterday

"i feel like when i tell someone i am a nihilist it doesnt really register, especially where moral principles are concerned. morality is subjective. to me, its clear as day. there is no wrong or right. there is no truth, there is only you and what you make the truth. thats why nobody can agree on any ethical conundrum. sometimes i feel like people arent ready to have that conversation. sometimes i feel like people dont think for themselves. i dont REALLY think that. there is me and then there is everyone else, and they are all individuals just like i am. like i said, i dont believe in wrong or right. it just is what it is. but when they talk about stuff like its so simple, just, i dont know. just the way people talk about things. everything is way too complex for me to express through language. i feel like in many cases the more words i use the less the truth comes through. i dont really believe that either because to me there is no truth but i still manage to get all worked up over things ive said.  what if i talked alot less and i spoke in the vague and cryptic way that i see fit i already dont have any friends. the only people i really have conversations with are my mom, sister, social worker, and occasionally my dad i am a teenager. socializing is performing no matter what. to live is to perform, really. but should i say things that i think will keep the other person interested should i mirror their attitude and sense of humor if i deliberately avoid doing that arent i still making a conscious effort to appear a certain way there are too many variables. i hate words and sometimes i hate everything else that comes with living too. sometimes life just feels like a nonstop onslaught of excruciatingly uncomfortable sensory input. i have to believe that there is a place for me but the second i think about it everything just feels like sharp, painful noise. i want friends but that doesnt seem like a realistic goal at this point in my life. i go to an alternative school where theres very few kids in my class and befriending any of them is pretty much out. i dont think i could get on well with most of my peers. something about their views, the way they joke, the things they like to talk about, the things they like to do. i dont know. looks like ill have to be alone for a while, at least. a lot of times life feels bad. more than it feels good. i hate thinking about what ive gotta do to make it better. it just makes me feel like ive wasted all my time here doing everything the wrong way when in fact there is no wrong way. that doesnt mean that i shouldnt try and do things differently though. i dont know, im so difficult. i hate myself.","1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0","especially,conversation,believe,deliberately,believe,alternative,differently",mixed,none,"conversation,register,morality,teenager,either"
"When I'm asked if I believe in magic,  my answer is that I absolutely do but 20 years ago outlook on it was quite different.

Today I sit with the anguish and an unsettling feeling when I think of the world and how many people are using the power of magic to hurt others.

I won't get into that but I'll just say, my intuition was screaming at me the  day I made the phone call not to make it but I just figured it was because of my previous criminal record and my problem with authority because of that.... I was very wrong.

Let's just say this small shithole of a town isn't ready for the inevitable...but it is inevitable and will happen eventually. There will be reckoning on the evil that has gotten away with the most disgusting things for way too long.

So I watched my daughter terrified of something...someone...multiple people on a daily basis before they tried to end my life and didn't succeed. They took her and the corruption took over.

This cult will be put to an end, I will make sure of it.

Then over a year later as I watched my fianc being affected by their work... See he got put in some kind of trance one evening amd wandered through the woods all night into the next day, after that he was never the same and was constantly insisting he needed to go into the woods, he was not the same person, his eyes would glaze over and it took me following him and basically forcing him not to go, I believe they were.doing divination on him. He didn't even know it and didn't remember alot of things when he was in that state of mind. I believe they sent him to put an end to me because I saw everything and their magic wouldn't work on me.

The night he committed suicide, I believe his mission was to put an end to my but somehow was able to break free of his hand and mutter the words ""baby please stop, I love you"" with the return answer being ""don't call me baby"" but then he suddenly got up pushed me into our daughters closet and told me not to come out, I think those words I was able to get out woke him out of his trance. As I opened the door, I saw him fumbling with what looked like something wrapped in a t-shirt ans then bang He was gone and they each snuck into my driveway with no hurry to their steps, the first officer acted like he had no idea he had shot himself,  the ambulance was third in showing up...the detective was last. He said he listened to my call and I repeatedly said he shot himself,  how do you not relay that to the emergency services, why was there no hurried intention, why no lights and sirens blaring. Why why why

I'll tell you why because they already had a plan or knew what was going on, this was our life non-stop for the last 2 years. I felt like I was some kind of actress on a twisted film with no script.

But you know what I hope every single person that had anything to do with any of it has underestimated as I assume they have....

This shall unfold quite wonderfully and every single individual will.be expose for the fucked up people they are and I will sit back and watch as each and every one of them tells on eachother.

And I wish to have room to turn my short cheesy skits into short 1-4 paneled comics.
Eventually turn it into either a book or a visual novel game, as a proof of use of my game asset store. If that doesnt work, then story time youtube channel.

I just hope these could motivate my loved ones to have something they like to do as well and be able to do them, to turn the things they are passionate about to something where they could gain more out of. Or at the very least, find things theyd love to do too.

"2025 November 24: Dear Diary,

Ask and it will be given. I was manifesting that I would do better at my job and I have been. Living without fear was another manifestation and I am starting to improve in this. Working on my creations, reading, and overall just enjoying life were things I have wanted to manifest and they are coming.  
  
Manifesting can be made simple. Sometimes I lose faith and things get scary. It can feel foolish, but then I see the results and feel vindicated. I should never doubt because that gets me nothing. My life is my own alone and I should focus on doing what the Universe asks of me.

"Dear diary,

today, I awoke like any other day. Well, I was woken out of my sleep with a call, that familiar sensation of nausea washed over me. Something to do with Cortisol. I wanted to go back to sleep, but my room is too hot and the fan isnt doing any justice. Once I am awake I am awake. Since yesterday evening, Ive felt this strange sensation. Something that feels like an absence. There is a stillness, a quiet that I am not used to. I dont know any other way to explain it. No it is not necessarily a bad thing but different. Like the presence of something you can feel but cant quite see has taken pause. Id never thought I would find myself questioning where its gone. Or that Id attached myself to it in any way. But thats the thing about familiarity. You only truly notice, once its gone. Or maybe I could be wrong and its the opposite of what I think. I have been having very bizarre and vivid dreams as of late. I intend to start writing everything down to make sense of things. I dont know. Something is different, something is shifting. I wonder if anyone else feels the same.","1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0","diary,yesterday,necessarily",negative,none,"familiarity,sensation,stillness,presence,absence"
"What a weekend I spent this weekend doing a lot of things mainly thinking about life and things I need to change I've gotten back into yoga recently as I stopped because my husband thought it evil because that he was taught. However he hasn't been complaining watching me stretch and bend at all so I must not be that evil huh

My original plan was to wake up early Saturday and start faking however I slept in instead not complaining at all and I only got to make one batch of brownies and a batch of fudge still not complaining because I actually got to bake like I wanted to I also cleaned up the house and did laundry as usual.

The exciting thing was I had a good surprise. My husband went to go get dinner Saturday night and I thought I would take a shower before I got back before I jumped in the shower I realized I'd forgotten my phone charger and I was almost out of my audiobook and my phone is dying. So I walked into living room to get my phone I was naked and I saw someone looking in my window not purposely looking in my window but just like as if you're turning to leave the porch it was my neighbor. The neighbor that I accidentally  purposely flash that one time apparently he was knocking on the door and I didn't hear him I pretend I didn't see him on the porch and instead of running back into the bathroom I started walking around the living room offending to pick something up and adjusting things he had gone back to his car by this time but I can still see him or my eye from his car looking into my window.

Now Sunday was a great day of relaxing finished up some laundry picked another batch of brownies for my coworkers finished my audiobook and I'm halfway through another book. As I was in the bedroom stripping the sheets off the bed to change them I hear noises I walk into living room and hear people talking to porch. My husband had grown out to get some fresh air turns out the neighbor was out there talking with my husband I was very scared actually that maybe he was telling my husband that he saw me naked but from what I can hear they're just talking about cars. 

As evening wound down I made a delicious dinner and I planned out my week it's a short work week coming up and I've been trying so hard each evening to do stuff for myself I'm hoping now with the extra days off from work I'll be able to do more for myself even though I still need to clean up my office before I can do any of my crafts LOL.","1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,1","recently,original,accidentally,coworkers,bedroom,dinner",mixed,fear,"neighbor,however,charger,another,dinner"

"I miss him. It makes it worse is that he is still my best friend but also not. So much more than. A friendship I have not been able to define. We share everything, every thought. Every happy moments,sad moments, hard truths. We bemoan our jobs,share good mornings and sleep well at night., Speak for hours even after he has taken his sleeping tablet and becomes groggy but refuses to hang up. He sends me pictures of his food or his beer. HIS CLIVIAS. But more than that, he brings so much sunshine in my life. His crazy stories and his constant teasing. The way I can always make him laugh,no matter how grim the situation. He cares so much,maybe too much. 
He has gone back to his ex,she still has a boyfriend. She needs him now, he says. The sex is so good But I dont see my bubbly, chatty buddy anymore.  Weekends and his birthday are now reserved for her. No more Saturday night cheesy movies or watching cricket or the Springboks kicking ass.
And now I dont see that happy side anymore. I only see the sad, serious part. I see someone who has to call his best friend when she is not around because she will get jealous and cut herself. He cant talk about me or go to the concert with me anymore. It upsets her. IS THIS what makes him happy 
I feel like I am having an affair with my best friend. I AM SO FUCKING SAD. 
I am conflicted and messed up. I want him to be happy but not at the risk of losing himself. I truly love this man. I love how he light up around me and how he brings out the softer side of me. I like the version of myself when I am with him. But I miss him. The crumbs coming my way arent enough. He says he misses me too.

"There are nights

when the silence grows too loud,

when even breathing feels like breaking,

and I sit in the dark

with nothing but my shaking hands

and a chest full of storms

no one knows exist.

People say time heals,

but time only teaches you

how to bleed quietly

how to hide the tremble in your voice,

how to smile like youre not drowning.

Some of us dont run from loneliness

we live with it,

sleep beside it,

wake up to it

like an alarm we never set.

And all I ever wanted

was a pair of arms,

a gentle warm hug to fall apart inside,

to break without being seen as weak,

a voice asking, Are you okay

and meaning it.

But not everyone gets chosen.

Some hearts were built

to sit in the back row of their own lives,

clapping for others,

waiting for a name that is never called.

So here I am

hugging myself because no one else will,

learning how to survive

without hands to hold,

learning that sometimes

the loudest screams

are the ones no one hears.

And if Im being honest

Im tired.

Tired of pretending Im fine,

tired of being strong alone,

tired of hoping someone might see me

before I disappear into the quiet.","1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0",silence,neutral,none,"loneliness,silence,never,ever,sometimes"

"TW death a few years ago, I'd briefly interacted with this kid in my college. He was a lot junior and overall a kind hearted soul. We'd briefly make small talk, he'd always joke about something and I'd often appreciate how unproblematic and lighthearted his presence was. I found out that he passed away and although its been ages since I even thought of him, something about that is very unsettling. I don't even know him but I think about how kind souls often fade away sometimes. but their memory and the way they made people feel will always remain.

"I just wanted to write about this because I'm up late stressing, so I might as well. 

I recently turned 18, and moved in with my best friend across the country. We were supposed to move to an apartment shared between us, but his mother insisted that we live at her place for a while. I have severe depression, and this house is beyond suffocating. She is somewhat evil in nature, and I think she genuinely might hate my guts now. 

Long story short, I decided I wanted to go home. I take a flight in the morning to leave and get out of here for good, hopefully never to return. I love my best friend, just not his mother. I wanted to stick it out, but it felt like my friend was also distancing himself from me and I was actively breaking our friendship by living together. 

My family is helping me move back, I barely scraped together enough to send some boxes home so I would have clothing to wear when I got there. And some small comforts to help moving back in be easier. 

So when I ran out of packing tape on a sunday when the store was closed and I truly didn't have the money to even buy a roll of tape, I felt a bit devastated. I walked to the store, praying that maybe my EBT card would work to withdraw cash. His mother berated me before I walked to the store, calling me stupid and all the other things shes been calling me. I was already pretty shakey, and I cry really easily. 

My card ended up not working. I had a few rolls and we tried to just see if it would work. When it declined, I just freaked out. I started crying, and I felt so stressed and freaked out on what to even do. But the person in line behind me paid for my packing tape. This naturally made me cry even harder, but I said thank you a lot through my tears.

I know I'll never be able to pay back that man, but I hope I can pay it forward one day when I'm no longer in this spot financially. Super nervous about my flight tomorrow, but I'm trying to keep in mind that there are kind people everywhere when you give them a chance. 

If you got here, thanks for reading. Kind of a tangent because I'm tired, and I doubt I'll get any sleep before I need to go to the airport. Its my first time flying, so I can only hope things go well.","1,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0","write,apartment,hopefully,friend,family,comforts,sunday,work,mother,card,emotion,everywhere",positive,hope,"depression,friendship,apartment,together,mother"

Him standing me up tonight says more about him than it does about me. He didn't do that because I'm not worthy of his time, he did it because he's too scared to move us forward OR let me go. If he can't make a decision, I need to. Because there might not be a timeline, but every time we get closer and then he pulls away, it hurts more. Every time I get over him and he comes back, it hurts more. I don't deserve to be hurt, or lied to, or misled. I deserve honesty and transparency. I need to draw limits with him and stop pretending this is going anywhere, or that we will ever be anything. Those fairytales might be comforting in the short term, but he keeps breaking my heart, and I keep picking it up and giving it back to him with both hands, and it has to stop. 

Update: After a long and painful conversation, we have officially decided not to move the relationship forward. He still wants to be friends and hang out when we both have time. But he's not ready for a commitment. He got out of a long and terrible relationship a little more than a year ago. I just got divorced about five months ago, just a few days before we met. So maybe I'm not either. We were both just looking for a hook up when we met.

Today I awoke with a heavy heart. Agitated with the unknown of what is inside and a heart I must just hide.

I had a mix of dreams and a struggle to sleep.

It was both about a fear and a desire.

She overpowers any darkness that sits upon my mind, but yet a heavy heart is restless.

Her beauty but that and more then a queen. Her eyes worth more and better looking then any and all jewels upon this earth.

Her heart and emotions feel much the same as mine but beauty pours from her.

If I could only reach for her, I may destroy the world.

For if she says yes, it will break the town upart, but if she says no, it will do both to break the town apart and flood the world with tears of sorrow.  

So I awake with new thoughts upon my mind, to add to the extra billion shuffling around, the thoughts of you, the thoughts of me, the thoughts of her, and the thoughts of many.

Is it that the heart is just a little down;

Is it maybe just a lust, or is she everything I used to dream about and now I want her as my escape;

Maybe I want her as everything, because she is everything, and I can also help her. 
 
I really stuck guys, I want her so bad.","1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0",dearest,negative,none,"darkness,better,overpowers,struggle,restless"
"Sitting in darkness I constantly ponder my own definition of sanity.

I see the world and hear the screaming in my ear, but the bounce never follows the echo.

I know what has to be done, but my body trembles at that which signals bleeding in front of me to stop, to run, to escape, to yell, to do something Anything, but standing still in the motion of existing. 

I tell myself over and over with the imaginary dreaded pebbles dripping from my forhead, taunting me to breathe without collapse. 

Breathe Breathe Breathe

My feet move with brilliance just the same as my hands labor to continue a routine my mind refuted, but still movement continues without the plain of my own presence. Just movement, just existence. 

Here I am again. Here I am. 

Is this my fault...

Well of course it is.

At least some part.

I stayed. I choose. I remained hopeful as one would when loyalty is of fault not of complacentcy.

I didn't think. Did I

Was I afraid Frozen Voided of spirit

Who am I, who was I

Why did I let this happen...

I'm here now. 

Now.

Now. 

I want to believe that what I desire is possible. I want to believe that fortune is only due in patience. But without movement, with presence, is fortune truly recognized Is fortune achievable

I hold the cards to my life as he held his all this time.

Do I move on. Will I ever find what I am looking for just being in this position I am cemented in. Is it fair

I am human. They would be too. 

We have choices. Just don't fall in love. And if you do let me bare it with clarity in my palms. Let me hold this gently. Carry it like a child born from womb to light. Tender affection I will carry this, sentive to breath. Just please breathe with me the air it quantified. Hold it, don't be afraid, when, if it comes to life, our lips may tremble, but I promise you will no longer tremble without embrace. 

Let's only hold it even if a moment is all to be had. Even if it lives without sin. Leave its designed innocence to dissolve within the divinity of our creation. 

Two labored shaken pounding hearts. 

To simply feel the connection of cosmic energy, touching tips of its effortless beauty. 

Fortune born from my deepest feathered sheets, whisper's in the plain of Dreamland. 

Lost souls dancing tunes of a love storybook.

Sigh.

"M18 I've had this feeling for quite some time now and it got stronger in the past few days. I think that people rarely want me the way I want them around me. I might seem not that interesting to them.irl and online I want to talk, but it's hard while being an introvert. I always wish that they start a conversation with me, because I made them interested in some way, my looks, my behavior, my interests, but no... I'm was always jealous of the friendship other people have together, they don't act like strangers together, they act like a family. 

Don't get me wrong, I reach out to them from time to time, but they don't really do it in return. Don't have time or forget about me... I don't want to be too pushy as I don't want to force them to meet up, it feels kinda wrong too. I have had good friendship in the past, but my friend just turned into a bad person for some reason and started to talk bad about me to other classmates. Now I only have a couple friends that I can show my true self with. It takes so much enegry to lead a conversation and I feel sad that I'm not that interesting to them.

This feeling gives me strenght if I think about it in the gym. I feel more motivated to look better, more apealing. But at the same time I feel hollow inside, I don't understand what I do wrong or how to change that. I only feel like myself amongst strangers if I'm in good mood and had enough sleep, as I have the energy to engage with more people. Ususally I'm quiet, and I hate it. If someone puts 60 into the conversation or the conversation is interesting, I can show my true self too. 

Maybe I'm bad in conversations, maybe I don't put in the work, maybe I'm not good enough for them. I'm just tired always being the first one to reach out all the time. I finally want to meet someone who is interested in me for who I am, who is thinking about me the way I think about them. I finally want to find love, but I'm tired to be the only one investing the effort. Same goes about friendship.

I overthink very much about that. It seems so easy for others. When it comes to conversations, there are moments when my mind turns blank and I have no words to say. I hate group talks as there are topics I can never talk about or when there is, I can't find my turn to start talking. 

That feeling got stronger a month ago when I was at a jam session at my college. It was a small event for students in the evening. I played piano there. I talked to some of them in the past. The listeners were close to the players and sat in a semicircle. I was a bit further away because of the instrument. As you thought not a single soul dared to talk to me. I left earier, as I felt kinda off. I wanted to say bye to people I talked to in the past, but they seemed not to hear me somehow. One of them said bye. Someone said I'm overthinking on that. And there are some days when I think it's true, but what if not

I'm not charismatic enough to get that kind of friendship with others, I guess.
There was also once a situation in a group setting at the jam session where a guy started massaging the head of a girl randomly, as she was sitting. They were friends. I can NEVER imagine that it will ever happen to me one day. Absolutely never. I was jealous... you can call me a bad person for feeling that. I know I should be happy for them, but still...

I feel kinda lonley or unwanted...

Now I just want to hug someone... please 

Thank you everyone for reading, maybe it sounds relatable to you in one way or another. 
Have a great day

"2025 November 23: Dear Diary,

Silly ideas come to me out of nowhere. A few days ago I had the idea to adapt a book that I love into a movie. Movies are perhaps my favourite medium of art, but they have always seemed so hard to make. When I was in film classes I could never understand the technical side of things, and that was just for the discussion of films. Actually starting to work on a film would take a lot of effort and I would not even know where to begin.  
  
At the moment I need to work on my own writing to get myself out there. I have a few novella and short story ideas that I should be working on at the moment. In the future I will probably try to adapt the book I love into a screenplay. If I can find a director to help me make it and if we can get the rights to the original work then that would be wonderful. If I can not do this then it would still be good to learn how to adapt a book into a screenplay.  
  
My brain is quite scattered. Focusing on one topic at a time can be quite hard to do. I already have many novella and short story ideas and now I have ideas for screenplays. Patience is something that I must master if I want any of these ideas to work well.  
  
Sincerely,

And every time I try to hang out with people, I feel answered with crickets. I hate being in this house alone, nobody wanting to hang out. Last night, we went to Friendsgiving, which i doubt id been invited to if it wasn't for her since everyone thinks we are still together. the softball guys were all getting together to play CoD. They get on discord and hang out. At the last tournament, they said they'd invite me to the chats. It's never happened. Even when bringing it up in front of me, no extension. The warhammer guys only play at odd hours, and outside of the game, we have nothing in common. I feel like there is nobody to share commonalities with aside from singular activities, so when it's life outside of softball or warhammer, I don't fit, I don't feel wanted. My ex kept life alive for me. I don't like resorting to TV or working to fill time. I should door dash, but it's hard when I feel like this. I want to do fun things with others, but nobody wants me around.

When I was in middle school I used to get a series of dreams where I would always hang out with the same woman doing different things and each time she would have a different face. I dont know why I was having those dreams so consistently but I was for sure that I was in love with her because every time I would wake up I would be crying and spend the rest of the day depressed that I woke up.

I miss the happier version of my past and the people who were part of it, and that nostalgia makes my present feel heavier. Repeated heartbreaks and the pressure of becoming an adult at 18 added even more weight, and the bac pressure has been sitting on top of everything, making me feel overwhelmed and mentally drained. Sometimes I feel unloved, undeserving, and like I dont deserve anything good. I even find myself thinking about what it might feel like to die not because I want to disappear, but because Im searching for relief from everything Im carrying inside.

On the topic of being more of my authentic self I somewhat bonded with one of my coworkers today. At the end of the night we talked about longer works of literature. I mentioned my plans to read War and Peace next month and the Tale of Genji later, both of which she enjoyed. She mentioned how Don Quixote was a great long work of literature.  
  
I am very happy that I got to have a conversation with someone. Typically I am quite nervous and reserved so it is a nice change to actually hold a conversation where I am sure it was enjoyable. Often I get worried that I have done something wrong despite there being no evidence, but I do not see that in this.  
  
Things are changing in my life. I am becoming the person I want to be and succeeding in doing so. Leaving my worries behind is something that is not only possible, but something that makes the most sense. For this I am grateful to the wonderful Universe.

Dec 13th, 2024:

there is a boy in my life recently, i only met him some days ago online, but, he is already very unique in my life. he doesnt speak to me the way others have before. he listens a lot, seems to have good intention of knowing me as a person. he lets me be upset with him, him listens to why i feel or think things, he also admits if he is wrong. hes also convinced me to make better decisions for respecting myself and recentering myself. today, when i got home, my father yelled at me drunk, got very violent and abusive and had me crying and yelling. i had my phone in my hand the whole argument. near the end i looked at my phone screen and saw i was on a video call with the boy. his side was dark and my camera was on. i felt my heart drop realizing he heard all of the yelling, and it just made me sit down and cry more. i hurried and hung up. he messaged and asked me if i was okay, even just sent my name after two minutes i didnt reply. i apologized for calling him and that it was an accident. its funny cause its actually how we met the first night, i had just got yelled at and told him about that, but now he witnessed the reality by chance. after i told him the call was an accident he told me it was fine. he told me i deserve to beat up my dad, and that he should learn to speak to me correctly. he urged me to move out. he also asked me later if i was okay now, i told him i was better. he said send a photo to prove you arent crying, that was so important to me, if someone didnt care they would never ask that. so i send a video of my eyes showing they are dry. he said perfect and just kept making sure i am okay and saying that i need to move because it is not worth it to be treated badly and hounded. i told him i will, and i really will move as fast as possible. i deserve peace and comfort. i am thankful for valentyn.

DECEMBER 20th: The boy told me he never cared, that i did too much to question why he didnt want to hangout. It occurred to me after as to why. When we met he told me any girl he ever liked would end up leaving him and choosing another guy. I realized in the morning as i listened to music, that this was his revenge to them. But, I would be the victim. He could finally be the one to hurt someone first and leave them like he had been left. Even if that meant killing his feelings for me too.

it matters where you are
there are people who let the distance of the world hold them from what they what
or their fear from what they want 
and in that, they only hurt other people.
they wont admit the reality of why they are standoffish 
they just leave you to feel like your wrong, messed up, or that its out of your hands, because thats just the way the world is

and maybe the reality is they just didnt feel the same as you, but theres a sneaking suspicion, they do, but you dont deserve it.

and sometimes, that person was the person to make it click for you. you finally realized from their loving treatment which wont ever be the same now, just what you wanted and what you deserve. 

theres always that question of what do you want in a partner, and its so hard to answer when youve never been treated fairly, or been seen. 

but then you FINALLY get that, and you think life is panning out correctly, maybe this is your time. they bring you joy and you feel that you do the same. but then the day comes and you hear that fateful goodbye again, the one disguised as a we are still gonna be the same, but those few words crush your ambition. 

youll find your person one day, just be yourself. 

and you feel like being no one, ever again.","1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0","yourself,listens,family,correctly,important,revenge,question",mixed,distress,"intention,treatment,argument,december,question"

I can always start again. Thats what its all about right Trial and error Truth be told I have no idea what Im doing, but I dont think that matters much anymore. Im focused on happiness, there are some days I wont feel so good. There are days that I wont feel or look my best. Its okay, we all have those days. I think the most important thing is that Im still here. I wont give up on myself. I love my people and my people love me. Thats more than anything I could have ever asked for.","1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0","luster,younger",positive,happiness,"happiness,younger,luster,error,ever"
"My husband and I got married last February. 6 months ago, I moved to his country and left the comfort of my life in my home country just so we could be together. I started working 2 months ago but ever since I moved here we barely see each other. It got worse when we decided to move out of his parents house because I don't want to live with his narcissistic mom. So he works from 2pm to 1am then does Uber from 3am to 7am on Mondays to Fridays and 10am to 4pm every Saturday if they have overtime while I go to work from 8am to 4pm Monday to Friday. The only time that we get to see each other on a weekday is during the 15-minute drive to my work. Dont ask about the weekends because most of the weekends, his mom will drag us anywhere. And when his mom does not drag us anywhere, hes on his computer playing games as per him that he needs to unwind and relax. We share 5050 in our household bills tho he needs to work overtime because his salary cannot pay his other bills condo unit, car loan amp; personal loan alone.

I have already suggested to him to look for a job that will pay more to settle all his dues without doing overtime but he dont want that and told me that he do not have the time to do it since he needs to Uber after work and do not have the mental capacity to look for a job or to know what he wanna do as his mind is on how he can get us out of his debt. I also suggested that if he do not want to look for another job then he must cut out his expenses by selling his condo so that with it, we can pay off his debt and he can focus more on making a career path for himself, but again he told me that he do not have the time to do the documents needed for his condo.

It gets frustrating spending the first year of our married life like this. If I only knew that we wouldn't be spending time with each other like when we were in a long-distance relationship, I would not have migrated sooner and left the comfort of my life in my home country. Back home, I have my car, my business and most especially my mom. I don't know if this is leading to resentment but I am so upset that he is not being a husband to me by doing romantic things like going out on a date or anything. I miss feeling like a woman. Every time I ask him to go out, I still need to force him to agree. I have opened this up with him a lot of times but it feels like were just running in circles having the same talk each month.

What I hate about everything is that I am having a thought of cheating or looking for someone who will make me feel like a woman. I hate myself for having that thought considering that I came from a relationship where I was cheated on and here I am thinking of doing what my ex did to me. Also, I hate the thought of like giving my ex the benefit of the doubt that maybe he did what he did because I was lacking for him, that I am not enough for him even though I gave him my best. And thats also the same reason that I am giving my husband right now, I can see that he is doing his best but how about my needs and feelings I don't know if I am right or wrong to feel this way. 

I am not sure if I want to hear any advice as my head is so clouded right now but I just want this off my chest.","1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0","february,family,months,family,work,weekends,work,family,family,resentment,relationship",negative,distress,"relationship,resentment,together,computer,capacity"

I tried to make friends with another girl my age at work and I asked her if she likes music and she literally laughed in my face and said that was weird. Like the mere idea that i am talking to her is a joke. I have no social skills. I get so scared to talk to people. And i am autistic. Its like the odds were stacked against me from the start.

"Where to start...

I 29F recently separated from my husband and I am happily ready to start hooking up with people but havent yet. I am bisexual but have not yet had any FF experiences.

I have been flirting with the new guy at work 30M, let's call him Wade, and things had been hotting up. I wanted to be open and tell him about my situation and that im dtf but didnt get the chance. Also in our team is Wade's long-time friend Daisy 43F who I've been working closely alongside all year.

Our whole team went out drinking and clubbing last night and it did not go as I expected. Half of the night Wade and I continued our flirting as we had been, but after we started doing coke he quickly became black-out, non-verbal level intoxicated. For the rest of the night it was clear he could only focus on Daisy. I had already suspected they have been casually sleeping together for a while.

Meanwhile, Daisy spent lots of the evening being extra attentive and sweet to me. Ive been suspecting from her behaviours at work that she has been crushing on me. After the rest of the team went home the three of us went to Wade's house. I felt Daisy was keen on exploring something spicy all together, and I seriously considered it. But it felt wrong knowing Wade was so intoxicated and I just dont feel any attraction towards Daisy, for lots of reasons but mainly our age gap. I fell asleep on the couch and the other two slept in bed together. They might have had sex but idk for sure. 

Daisy left early in the morning and Wade and I spent the most awkward morning together. He told me he blacked out for most of the night. He then asked me straight up about my husband and kids, which wasn't a secret but I hadn't been open and honest like I intended. That seemed to make up his mind about me. I felt so deflated. I have been crushing on Wade for weeks, I finally was alone with him, in his house, I genuinely fucked up, messing around with him without being honest.


TLDR: My crush is in love with another girl, who has a crush on me, which led to an awkward threesome opportunity and lots of hang-xiety.","1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1","start,work,family,together,opportunity",positive,affection,"opportunity,attraction,situation,together,another"

I dated a lot when younger but never cared about going out at night, drinking or smoking. I was funny around people and overtime I feel like I lost my social skills and now it is hard making good friends. It seems everyone likes the fast like but I like the normal lowkey relaxing, tv watching, and yard work on weekends.

Ive been dating my girlfriend for about 4 months. We met on hinge and started off with long distance. When i asked her to be my girlfriend i hadnt even met her. Its been tough. But when im physically with her things are so good. She is a bit busy and sometimes i am too so we dont really facetime that much. But because of that i miss her even more. I love her so much and miss her immensely but i dont know if i can do long distance. Theres no possible future where we end up together physically. But idk if im not trying hard enough. I feel guilty about breaking up because i love her so much and i know she needs me more than i need her. But at the same time. Its just so difficult idk if i can do this.

"What did you say You're not talking to me if you're in a different room. Rooms filled with emotions,  traumas unspoken, everything is broken, shattered to pieces...

    Wanted...needed peace and quiet, a life of happiness but ended up with some distorted, twisted, mentally insane riot.

   You were you and I was I, souls connected for eternity, the undeniable tug, the never ending pull....my love, my love are you there Understanding with just one stare, no one will ever compare...fuck this cold air, can't seem to get warm, you used to say I was on fire, that my skin burned.

  I sat with an old woman the other day, she spoke of her husband and told me she had been alone for 20 years, he died suddenly and life isn't fair. It's all a stupid test, to see who can survive the fucked up game, that you one day just ended up in, I sat there everyday questioning my sanity amd and begging to be woken up...thinking e I'm just Alice or Dorothy and any second I would wake up and it will have juat been some fucked up nightmare I was in.

   This house is alive, it needs a name, it definitely needs some meds because the mood swings of it are unreal. I feel like they peeled back my scalp inserted things into brain that shouldn't be there so I could here every echo, every voice of the house...still don't know if I'm alive or dead, maybe in a coma or in a different dimension. All I ever feel in this house is tension....is it a man or a woman Definitely has more than one personality so there's men, women, children and zombies.

11:11 on the clock, make a wish, time for a change. Because this place is deranged, everyday is the same, groundhog day, never lived life feeling so strange more and more as each day passes. 

The neighbor mows the lawn everyday, steals our electricity and invades our brains with radio waves. WaaaaWaaaaWaaaaaa expanding then releasing. Why at 4 a.m. is this place freezing. 

   You come in, from wherever you disappeared to all day...not sure where you're at, couldn't really say, all I know is this place is not okay, night and day, there is no fun, there is no play. Hey baby I say to you, uneasy in a way. Unsure if your eyes will be black or the real you busting through the spell...I cannot tell just yet, how do you feel now I feel like our life is a live movie set, we have no control of the next scene...I tell myself someday I'll have the answers and our life will once again be happy and normal...maybe if we have a lobotomy. 

Now I sit with a tear filled, blank stare....I can feel you, I feel your presence but I can't see you....spraying on your cologne so I don't feel alone, dancing around with your spirit every night, hugging you tight, with my head on your shoulder...in this moment I only forget for a second that you're gone forever...then I think back to the old woman and her being alone for 20 years since her husband passed away and realized if I  live to be 80 then I'll double her 20.

"Its been a hard week for me, dealing with my family, personal struggles, problems. Lots of things happening all throughout my life. Im exhausted. I feel so lonely even at times I am with my friends, and also i have not been able to vent out to anyone recently because ive also been keeping tabs on how they are before saying something that may affect their own mental health as well. So i just had to keep it to myself. But lately its been so so heavy. I just need an outlet to let it out. Let some out. I hope somebody feels when im not at my best even if i dont have to tell them, sometimes i wish someone would check up on me just because. Because randomly, i do it too to my close friends.. I cry myself sometimes, because i am so so tired, of adjusting every single time. Sometimes i want to let it all out and scream to my brother, to my mom, but then it all comes down to me considering again the health condition of my mom, what she would feel if she witnesses me having a dreadful argument with my brother. How i wish i lack the empathy, to feel what others would feel if i did what i did, said what i said. So that i could do anything without feeling the guilt. But no, its always hard for me. My partner is also struggling so I really have no guts to tell him ive been feeling this way for a while now, im trying to figure things out on my own, just so that i wont affect his mental health as well. I wanted him to live his life as well so, as much as possible i dont want to be a hindrance. I know its selfish that i do not get to tell him what i am going through right now, but he is also on a mental state that hardly I cannot explain as well, he is also in a dark place. Im thinking if we both go talking about these things right now it might affect him more than myself. I just hope everything ends well with me, and also with him, i mean our problems. Sometimes i wish i could leave home, and think about myself.. just myself. So that i could focus on my healing, Actually, ever since the pandemic came, its been a roller coaster ride for me, and ive been so so so so so tired of being strong for my mom, for the family, weve been arguing every now and then, and Im hurting to see these things happening. When my dad was alive everything was so much lighter even when there were a lot of problems. But after he passed 3 years ago, i have to step up, to take care of my mom, and the relationships in this family. Its just so exhausting, and ive been telling my mom always, that if it was not for her i would not be staying at this house. I just really want to look after her, i just cannot let her be. For years now ive been wanting to live separately but considering my moms old age i just cant let her be alone, my siblings has their own family too, so they really cannot look after her all the time, so i have to sacrifice, again just like when my dad had been hospitalized. I am the youngest but i feel like ive been doing so much, so so so much for the family even before.. I always have to be the mediator between the arguments, the fights, misunderstandings, i always do the job. Its so draining. sometimes i just want to shout at them and walk away. Sometimes i want it all to end kasi hirap na hirap nako. Id rather be at some other place than the house except when my mom needs me, because i can avoid everything. Im just so tired. My heart aches everytime im at the house, it does not feel like home anymore It makes me sad to feel this way, but that is what i really feelSana matapos na lahat ng to","1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1","family,health,family,health,family,family,misunderstandings,rather,family",negative,sadness,"condition,hindrance,argument,mediator,brother"

you looked even prettier than before.  
As if time has been painting you gently,  
while I stood still, just watching.

The wind must have learned its grace from your walk,  
and the sun its glow from your smile.  
Every glance of yours felt like poetry unspoken,  
every breath of mine, just waiting for you.

I saw the sparkle in your eyes,  
like constellations drawn only for me to lose.  
Your laughter spilled like music in the air,  
a melody I wanted to listen inside too.

Even the silence around you spoke,  
like soft prayers whispered to the sky.  
And in that moment, I knew again  
you are the reason beauty feels divine.

"Im a really big fan of me to an almost narcissistic degree, I really really like me and I can do no wrong in my own eyes. There are few things about me I genuinely dont like and one of those few things is the fact im human, its not something I can change or work with, there's nothing I can do about it. Being human isnt a bad thing, i just feel like I could do better.

I have many faults, I know i do im only human, even if I dont see them as faults I know they're there. Im not okay with it, im okay with the faults I do have since to me im basically perfect, Im not okay with other people not knowing im perfect. That can't really happen tho considering perfection doesn't really exist and is just an opinion. I want other people too see me and love me the way I see me and love me.

I crave attention, companionship, and understanding from other people. Which is kinda weird considering the fact I don't like people, infact I find people to be disgusting and overall unpleasant. I am I hypocrite, I am disgusting and overall unpleasant but like its okay when I do it.

I feel genuinely superior to other people in a way that I can't completely explain but I know has no actual logic or reason behind it. I want other people or atleast on other person to feel and know im superior and perfect, i want them to feel like im a god. But that can't really happen. 

I supposed I could create someone, I could have a child and groom them into believing it, or I could have someone fall in love with me and try to convince them of it. The child wouldn't know any better and the person would hopefully be too blinded by love to notice im lying to them.

 If god is real, i wonder if this is how he feels, if this is the reason we were created, he wanted someone else to realize how beautiful and perfect he was. I wonder if he knows how selfish that is but were his creations and his children, if he can why shouldn't he Or maybe god is more like an author, we're so beneath him we're not even real, hes not really hurting anyone just creating stories and playing with his toys, maybe our feelings are so lowly he doesn't know hes hurting us and even if he does know he can't quite understand the extent. 

It doesn't really matter much, we'll probably never find out. I kinda want to be a god, but thats not possible. I'll have to settle for grooming and manipulating someone into think im a god, if someone believes im a god does it really make me one I dont think it does but I can pretend, its the closest ill get after all.","1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0","narcissistic,work,people",mixed,hope,"companionship,perfection,attention,superior,better"

I will hold you in my dreams,

I choose to keep you in my heart,

I will smile when I see you laugh,  
Even if that laughter isnt meant for me.  
I will pray for your peace every night,  
Even when mine refuses to stay.

I will write to you in poems Ill never send,  
Hide them between pages that no one will ever read.  
I will keep your memories safe in my silence,  
Like a secret I never wish to lose.

I will listen to the songs you loved,  
Till they no longer hurt but hum softly inside me.  
I will whisper your name to the stars,  
As if the universe might still carry it to you someday.

I will stand where you once stood,  
Feel the air you once breathed,  
And in that small, fleeting presence   
I will find you again, quietly.

"Ill start this journal with the thing that bothered me more than it should have.

Ive been unsettled by my recent conversations with J, and today I finally tried to untangle why. It wasnt a single momentit was a slow accumulation of tiny misalignments that eventually tipped into irritation.

First, to be fair: not everything she said was meant to attack me. Some of my discomfort came from my own history. When I told her I dont usually talk to younger people, that came from my experience of dating someone older when I was 19. That relationship made me hyper-conscious of power dynamics and the responsibility that comes with age. We had a good conversation about that. I agreed with her, and I know shes an adult capable of making her own decisions.

But the rest They made me squint at our exchanges with suspicion. And I got tired of squinting real quick.

Js energy is extremely sexualflirtatious, explicit, over-the-top. As you would expect from someone in their early twenties. Normally, that wouldnt bother me. Im vulgar myself. I flirt, I joke, Im not prudish. But the difference is: I know when to match energy and when to hold back. I dont machine-gun sexual comments into every gap in the conversation. I dont turn everything into kink talk just because I can.

But okayshe kept bombarding me with her TMIs. None of it was particularly disturbing, so I let her be. Eventually I thought, fine, Ill share a little of my own TMI.

I brought up how I had this favorite nude photo of myself with an ex amicable breakup. How I loved that photo and how I wanted to turn it into an art portrait. I mentioned an artist Ive followed for years who does nude art commissions tied to her thesis on empowering women, especially those whose nude photos were leakedhow they were exposed and then blamed for it, punished for taking photos of their own bodies. I went on to say I regretted deleting all my nudes because well, Moira Rose from Schitts Creek said it best:

gt;Take a thousand naked pictures of yourself now. You may currently think, Oh, I'm too spooky, or, Nobody wants to see these tiny boobies. But believe me, one day you will look at those photos with much kinder eyes and say, Dear God, I was a beautiful thing

Ive believed this since college. Ive always loved boudoir photos, nude art, and all that.

Then she responded:

Damn, youre fine sharing your nude with a random artist

And,

Why did you think she would draw you with a cock in your mouth

I explained the thesis againempowerment, reclamation, art as resistanceand she replied with:

Thats a way to empower women lol.

All while she talked freely about her own kinks.

What bothered me wasnt the sexual contentit was the lack of depth behind it. I brought up something thoughtful and vulnerable, like how nude photography felt empowering to me, how art can reclaim shame, and she responded with sarcasm, kink-bragging, and shock value. It felt like I was offering introspection and she was offering performance.

I hated that it bothered me this much. I wanted to understand why she didnt view it as empowering, because maybe I was missing a perspective. And I genuinely wanted to learn something from someone youngermaybe she had a fresh angle. She tried a bit, I guess. She asked what the artists work was about which I had already explained. She asked what I expected from the portrait.

But the energy felt off. Sarcastic. A little passive-aggressive. I wanted to understand her viewpoint, but I lost all appetite for the conversation. I let her gush about the girl shes in love with and just checked out.

Its exhausting.

And it hit methese past few days, I dont think I gain anything from these conversations. Not insight, not connection, not warmth. She said she really enjoyed the deep conversations we had at the start. Well, if thats the case, I dont think shell mind if I pull away, because the TMI-heavy, sexual, masturbation-centered conversations arent serving me anymore. As much as I enjoy talking about those things, they get boring for me quickly.

I had hoped to learn something from her perspectivesomething fresh or challenging. But the truth is, her age shows. Not in a bad way, but in a natural, developmental way. Shes 23. Shes supposed to be chaotic, reactive, flirtatious, defensive, and a little morally rigid. Thats what your early twenties look like.

But Im 33. And no, that doesnt mean Im above herit just means Im not in that phase anymore.

I can be chaotic too, in how I think, in how I thrive in gray areas. But I really dislike sarcastic, dismissive energy. I love well-intentioned debatebut lets do it calmly, with introspection, without mockery. The goal is to learn from one another, to notice perspectives we didnt see before.

Its only been a couple of days, but Im tired of forcing myself to keep up with an energy that doesnt suit me.

I dont dislike her. Im not angry. Im not judging her. If anything, Im more annoyed at how much this is bothering me today. But Im recognizing that she isnt someone I can have the kinds of conversations I wantlayered, calm, reciprocal, open, reflective. Shes in her phase of loud expression, and I want her to enjoy it. But Im in my phase of quiet understanding. Theres no shame in that.

I need softness. I need curiosity. I need emotional intelligence. I need maturity. I need conversations where both people are actually listening. I need all of that in this tumultuous season of my life. Im done with the loud. I want slow and calm. My nervous system certainly needs it.

So I think Im ready to step back. And honestly, I dont think shell mindor even noticeif I do.

On a calmer notetodays borrowed solitude.

I had the house to myselfwell, the first floor, at least. My siblings stayed up past three in the morning, and I guess thats why my sister wasnt up when I left my room and went downstairs to the kitchen.

Im still exhaustedas always. Whats new But I had just enough energy to whip something up for myself and then cook dinner for the family. Probably not the ideal choice, but I ate fire noodles before starting dinner prep.

I had my mellow playlist playing on the TV. It felt peacefulthe music, the quiet house, me preparing my fire noodles with scrambled eggs and hotdogs yeah, I know not healthy, pero djame vivir hoy. Moments of borrowed solitude always make me wonder if Ill feel this same softness when I finally live alone for realfor months, maybe years. Maybe yes. Maybe there will be stretches of loneliness too. I dont know yet.

For now, I just need these tiny pockets of borrowed solitude. For some reason, in moments like this, I notice that I can actually sit through my racing thoughts long enough for them to settle. Or maybe I simply stop caring that theyre racing. Im just sitting with themside by side, not fighting anything.

I like this.

Im still exhausted, but I can feel the heaviness slowly dissipating from my body. And I realize: when Im secure enough, Im going to enjoy living alone. Ive always been a loner, and solitude really is my element. One day definitely one dayIll be stable and confident enough to live on my own, and Ill trust myself to handle everything that comes with it.

I can even have moments like this, I thought. Where I pause in the middle of whatever Im doinga chore, anythingand write down my thoughts for the days journal. Whether I write it tonight or not.

I like being alone with myself, letting the calm music carry me wherever it wants.","1,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0","journal,conversations,misalignments,responsibility,normally,currently,beautiful,boudoir,work,gush,conversations,introspection,angry,today,notetodays,myselfwell,dinner,peacefulthe,solitude",mixed,anger,"againempowerment,responsibility,introspection,accumulation,relationship"

"I Google a chick I have been trying to find and since I don't know her last name I am confused as fuck about how I don't know her when I know like everyone from the circles I frequently visit. Her though. I know her family members apparently though they dont talk to her because well lets be truthful she is probably embarrassed since they are drug fucked right  And seems they must have hurt her coz they always apologizing on her fb. What's the chances I could find her on here. Probably slim since 80 percent are from the Usa. I don't even pay attention anymore I realized I wanted the man I marry to sing to me and it isn't often I hear a man sing sexy and think he is unattractive even if they get the words wrong lol so long as they rhyme and look at me im like a melted mess but hell now someone is singing their little heart out and I don't even look at him. But any idea why that is well fuck apart from its too late for this now coz I have had my heart not just broken but it is quite certainly being taken as a big fat fucking joke when I bring any thing up and I am laughed at.... It sort of makes me feel like I am going to explode and then I have insane thoughts of terrorism and torture beyond my minds capacity ever before. Anyway then I think well why didn't I hear songs when I met this guy. And hey the mention of excitement in my life about maybe meeting or watching some other couples, well excuse me because when we met I would have walked into any room with anyone in it and held my composure and I'm jealous and possibly possessive at times but I was never ever insecure I knew I would still have a chance even if the woman in the room were super models I never lost a man to anyone else in a situation where there were opportunities for whomever I was with to leave with other women I didn't even go home alone ever ever. Something happened when I met him and I just slowly became a person I didn't like and I definitely can't self care because if I check what I look like in a mirror I really feel like I am going to die before I get the chance to ever try and find out what the fuck you have actually done to me to cause so much damage in so little time but well i want to fill you in on my thoughts all day today and today I am thinking about whether I will be today a day closer to being the same as 36 year old Australian chick who invented canva can't remember her name but I hope my plans work out for my three apps and one website but how do I proceed with more website plans with no clue what I'm doing and how expensive will it be to get rich lol","1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1","frequently,family,work,work",neutral,none,"excitement,attention,terrorism,situation,capacity"
"You stayed when I was breaking things I didnt understand,  
when my silence cut deeper than my words would ever pretend,  
You carried pieces of me I threw away myself,  
and called it love  even when it burned your hands.

You hid your tears behind gentle smiles,  
kept your pain quiet so I could scream mine.  
I thought your patience was weakness,  
but it was the strongest thing Ive ever seen alive .

You were light walking beside a storm,  
and I was too blind to see the way you trembled.  
You gave me peace while I gave you chaos,  
and still, you never left until I made you go.

Now I sit with the ghosts of your kindness,  
and every memory feels like an apology too late.

my heart still remembers what it feels like to stay.

I see her laugh from a distance now,  
a sound Im no longer a part of.  
The world moves around her so easily,  
while mine freezes in the moment our eyes dont meet.

There was a time when her voice  
used to be home.  
Now its just an echo I chase  
through empty corridors of memory.

I tell myself Im fine,  
that Ive learned to live without her,  
but every night, when silence gets too loud,  
her name still finds its way through my chest.

I wish I could tell her  
how it feels to breathe beside her again   
not to hold her, not to ask her to stay,  
just to exist in the same air  
without falling apart.

those endless oceans that hold both fire and mercy,  
that light of dawn which shatters the darkness.

that melodic tone that feels like music,  
every word she speaks  
feels like my name finally learning its meaning.

I want her hands   
those gentle and firm hands   
not to hold them,

can carry the weight of the world.  
Hands that could calm even my shivering heart.   
I want to trace the lines of her palms,

to write my name there.

I want her silence too

a place where I could rest my tired faith.

her soul that glows without trying,  
her kindness that could heal even gods.

I want her faith,  
her flaws,  
her fire   
every shade of her existence.

I want to live where her spirit breathes,  
in the rhythm of her heartbeats,

"Dear diary, I want to smash a glass bottle and slit my wrist. I want to hold another piece and squeeze it till the blood drips from my hand. My thighs are already covered in red zebra stripes; maybe I should add some more. While I cry in the shower in a puddle of my own blood, I will remind myself that nobody ever treated me with respect and kindness, and nobody ever will. In a world so cruel, with a heart full of love, but nobody to give it to. Please, don't fool me, don't lie to me, don't tell you love me, because daddy said I am not even attractive enough and that I am too dramatic. While I stare at the shower wall and let the warm shower droplets gently kiss my body, I wonder what it feels like to be held by my mom. And as my blood slowly slips away like my life, together with all the possible experiences I could have had, but I was too sad to even chase them, so now they are down the drain. With all the possible energy left in me, I stand up and grab a towel, sweeping away my tears, but as I see my disgusting body I weep again. People will define my pain as body dysphoria, but there is nothing really wrong with my body. It's the dirty hands of others staining my skin, the reminder that I am just a disgusting human in a society but not a pretty free butterfly...","1,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0","bottle,nobody,attractive,experiences,health",mixed,sadness,"kindness,together,reminder,another,shower"
"Tonight feels different.  
Not because the world changed  
but because shes not in it anymore,  
not in the way my heart still searches for her.

She isnt here anymore  
not the way she used to be,  
not the way my heart learned to live.  
Her voice isnt my shelter now,  
her presence isnt the hand I reach for,  
and every corner of my life  
feels colder because of it.

I dont know how to return  
to the version of me that existed  
before she touched my world.  
Everything feels heavier  
my thoughts, my chest, my nights.  
Even the air hurts.

She was the thread holding me together,  
and now that thread has snapped  
I am unravelling, piece by piece,  
and no one is here to see.

I keep telling myself Ill survive,  
but even my lies have started trembling.  
Because the truth is simple, brutal  
without her, every day is just something to endure,  
not something to live.

She wont text.  
Now she will never ask if Im okay.  
She wont hold the version of me  
thats collapsing in the dark.  
My life was already a quiet hell,  
but at least she made the flames softer.  
Now it burns louder, hotter, closer  
and I have no one to save me from myself.

Every second without her  
feels like someone is dragging nails  
 inside of my heart.  
My mind keeps replaying her laughter,  
her care,  
the way she held my brokenness  
like it didnt terrify her or ever scare her.

She was the only person  
I could fall apart in front of.  
The only voice that could silence my storms.  
The only warmth I had in a world  
that is always too cold for someone like me.

And now the world feels colder than ever.  
Every room, every thought, every breath  
it all echoes with the truth  
Im terrified to accept:  
Shes gone.  
Not dead.  
Just gone from me.  
And it hurts more than death ever could.

I dont want to be strong.  
I dont want to move on.  
I dont want to pretend Im okay.  
I just want her.  
Her eyes, her voice, her comfort,  
her way of understanding me  
before I understood myself.

I am trying so hard not to fall apart  
but God,  
its so hard to breathe  
when the person who once held your heart together  
is now the reason its tearing itself apart.

And still  
in all this pain,  
in all this drowning  
one truth doesnt change:  
I still love her.  
Maybe too much,  
maybe enough to destroy myself,  
maybe enough to let her go  
even when it kills me.  
Because she deserves peace  
even if it takes mine with it.","1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0","different,health",positive,affection,"brokenness,presence,together,laughter,shelter"
"I wanted her   
in the simplest, purest way.  
To wake up and see her face in the soft morning light,  
to trace constellations in her palm ,  
to talk about nothing until it started to mean everything.

I wanted to look into her eyes   
those diamond-bright, river-deep eyes,  
that make time stop breathing,  
To lose myself in them  
and forget that the world outside ever existed.

I wanted to feel her hands,  
those soft, gentle, steady hands   
the ones that looked like they were made to hold the world,  
and yet, could calm my chaos with a single touch.

I wanted to hear her laugh   
that unfiltered, bell-like sound  
that makes even silence want to dance.  
To see her bindi catch the sunlight,  
her earrings swaying like small stars,  
her hair flowing like a river that never ends.

I wanted to tell her that shes peace disguised as a person,  
That her soul glows even in the dark,  
that when she speaks,  
even the wind stops just to listen,  
and just her glance makes pain pass by

But life  
life decided to keep her at a distance.  
Not far enough to forget her,  
but just enough to remind me that she was never mine.

Now, I watch her from where she cant see me   
still perfect, still luminous, still divine.  
And though I cant hold her,  
I hold her presence like a secret prayer.

I talk to her in my thoughts now,  
listen to her laughter in echoes of memory.  
I love her quietly   
in ways shell never know,  
in places shell never look.

And maybe thats love too   
not the kind that asks,  
but the kind that accepts.  
Not the kind that demands to stay,  
but the kind thats grateful it ever existed.

She walks beneath the same sky,  
and maybe, somewhere between stars,  
my love still reaches her   
not to touch, not to change,  
just to say:  
I still see you.

Because some loves dont need forever.  
They just need a heart willing to keep loving,  
even from far away.","1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0","simplest,sunlight,health,quietly",positive,calmness,"distance,presence,laughter,silence,forever"
"You never had to stay,  
but you did.  
When I was nothing more than noise and fear,  
you sat beside my silence  
and turned it into strength.

You held my trembling hands  
as if they were meant to be still.  
You looked at my chaos  
and somehow saw something worth saving.  
You gave me pieces of peace  
when you had none to spare.

Your voice  soft, steady   
became the bridge between my storms and calm.  
Your laughter was a light  
that taught me warmth could exist  
without fire.

I still remember how your eyes  
could quiet every ache inside me.  
How your kindness never asked for recognition,  
and your words  simple, honest   
felt like prayers whispered straight to my soul.

You carried me when I couldnt walk.  
You believed when I had stopped believing.  
You gave  and never once asked  
for anything in return.

If love had a shape,  
it would look like your patience.  
If grace had a sound,  
it would be your voice saying,  
Im here for you.

And even now   
when distance has turned your presence into memory   
I still thank you.  
Not for what you did,  
but for who you are.

Because you didnt just heal me,  
you taught me how to heal myself.  
You didnt just help me live   
you reminded me what life could feel like  
when its touched by someone good.

So this is my prayer,  
my apology,  
my quiet bow to you:

May every smile you gave me  
come back to you in brighter ways.  
May every pain you carried for me  
turn into something gentle.  
May every part of your heart  
find the peace it once gave to mine.

So  
thank you  for each and everything.  
For every day, every night, every time I needed you.  
Thank you for being here with me.  
Thank you for making me realize my strength.  
Thank you for helping me believe in my dreams again.  
Thank you for listening when no one heard my voice.  
Thank you for seeing my pain when no one tried to.

And most of all   
thank you for staying,  
when no one else did.

Thank you.  
Thank you for everything.","1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0","never,patience,health",positive,calmness,"recognition,laughter,remember,kindness,patience"

"I am trying to forget you   
not because I stopped loving you,  
but because loving you now  
would only hurt you more.

I wake up every day and unlearn your name,  
like tearing petals off a flower  
that still smells like you.  
I try to bury the warmth you left behind,  
but it keeps blooming  
in every corner of my silence.

You were never mine   
I knew that from the start   
but my heart still built a home for you  
in places it shouldnt have.  
And now, every breath I take  
feels like walking through that empty house,  
hearing echoes that refuse to fade.

I still see you in the softest things   
the morning light, the sound of rain,  
the way the wind moves like a memory.  
I still hear your laughter  
in places it doesnt belong.  
And when the night grows too quiet,  
it feels like the world is asking  
why Im still holding on  
to someone whos already free.

So I am trying   
not to erase you,  
but to live with the ache of you.  
To let the love stay,  
but the longing go.

Maybe this is what real love means   
not having,  
but wishing well.  
Not holding,

And maybe one day,

"I am in love with a soul that knows only love,  
a soul that may break itself  
but never let go of the ones it holds.

I am enchanted by a mind  
that shows kindness at every turn,  
that feels the pain of others  
as if it were its own.

I am the lover of a smile  
that is not bound to a face,  
but reaches the heart  
like a prayer softly answered.

I have learned to listen to the silence,  
for even there she speaks,  
her quiet mercy saying everything  
without a single word.

I adore the purity of her emotions,  
as sacred as a mothers love  
a love that only gives,  
never asks, never takes.

To live beside her soul  
is to discover my own existence,  
to breathe her breath  
is to build my world anew.

For in a single smile of hers  
my whole universe rests.  
She is no ordinary being  
she is a blessing,  
a prayer gifted to me by God.

And even if I forget myself,  
I only want to remain within her.  
Not with just her face,  
not with just her form,  
but with her soul  
that is where my love belongs","1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0","itself,health,reaches",positive,affection,"existence,kindness,discover,silence,prayer"
"I Miss You

In my most silent days,  
I miss you the loudest.

 Though I was never the warmth of the sun  
you long for on a winter morning,  
nor the evening rain you dance within,  
nor the starlit sky that keeps you awake all night  
but you were all of these to me.

Your presence, your smile, was full of warmth and comfort,

I felt a gentle breeze on my face each time you blinked,  
saw sunlight gleam in your nose pin,  
watched your hair shine brighter than day  
after the rain had touched it.

Every word of yours still lives in my mind,  
every picture of you rests in my heart.

I miss you a lot   
when you asked me about my day,  
when your texts washed away my tiredness,  
when your voice turned frustration into calm.  
You made my incomplete thoughts whole,  
my unheard silence finally heard.

I really miss you a lot

I miss you every time a blink,

 I miss you every time a breath,

 I miss you every night thinking about you and just you,

I really miss your light which gave me hope,

I really miss our conversations, gentle as a mothers love.

I really miss that pretty face of yours,

but even more,  
I miss your soul  
the kindest, purest, most loving soul  
that showed me my own worth.

That love,  
which taught me how to love,  
though it was never mine  
I miss it.  
I miss you.

some days i feel totally fine, like im finally getting a sense of myself. then the next day i feel like im back at square one, questioning everything. my goals, my personality, the people around me, what i actually want for my future. its exhausting feeling this unsure about things that seem so obvious to everyone else.

i really hope this is just a phase, or part of growing up, or something that eventually settles. im trying to be patient with myself, but its hard not to feel overwhelmed by all the uncertainty. i just want things to make a little more sense soon.

if anyone else has been through this or is going through it now, itd be nice to know im not the only one feeling this way.","1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0",lately,neutral,none,"personality,uncertainty,eventually,everyone,actually"
"Bear with me it's a long story.

I'll avoid names and details for obvious reasons,  but I have or had not sure yet a friend of 6 years, who just got a horrible divorce about a year ago, her ex-husband husband did something horrible that still boils me to this day, my friend after the divorce lost temporarily custody of her 5 kids but they managed to stay with family so in all not that horrible there at least, she became extremely depressed, almost all her friends turned their back on her by telling her that why didn't she noticed first and such horrible assholes. Seeing this and me knowing all that transpired I just couldn't just stand back, so I offered my help in everything I could, talks till 2 - 4 am, cooking, offering advice and support, etc. 

Fast forward 8 months after and we're talking more often and going out for coffee as she's finally starting to come out of the shell but still sensitive on a few days a week, so one day she decided to tell me that she's had a crush on me but never did anything out of fear of loosing my friendship, I won't lie I was expecting that at some point as I was starting to consider it also, but it wasn't the right thing to do, not while she was still recovering from the trauma of the divorce and all that entailed, so I told her: 

""You're an amazing woman, I won't lie I've thought about it more than once also, but I don't want to take advantage of you while you're still healing, I want you to focus on your kids for now and yourself, if in a month or two or whenever you feel ready, and you feel the same then ask me again and we'll go out and see where it leads""


 I do love her, and I realize that this was probably a stupid thing to do but I do have my reservations for being with people specially when kids are involved. 

When I was younger before I met her my girlfriendpartner of the time got pregnant, I was happy and ready to start a family, but she was scared or it looked like that to me, and she told me she wasn't ready, she was almost 3 months pregnant when we realized, so I told her that I understood that I wasn't going to force her even if I was ready and wanted it because she was the one carrying our daughter, so she aborted...
Our relationship never recovered, after a while one of her friends suggested to her that she should erase me from her life and she agreed, when she told me I was just numb and I just let her do as she wanted.

A year and a half later I see her in a city festival and she's with the ""friend"" that suggested she erased me from her life, and they're pushing a baby stroller... 

So now with my friend who I helped through her divorce and trauma, 3 weeks ago she calls me and  starts texting me how she got introduced to someone, that a friend insisted, well according to her, the guy is exactly like me. 
""He's like you, he has the same sense of humor and manners, he says the same jokes and behaves the same, it's like you but Asian"" and such she tells me after she met him and they start texting. 

They go out for a date and she asks me to babysit her kids, I accept and I don't think too much about it as she told me it's just as friends, and during her date she says the same thing to me how he's just like me... They end up sleeping together the same night, and she tells me about it the same night when she picks up her kids as we talk in private so they don't hear, I play along and say that I'm happy for her that she had fun even if I'm dying on the inside, the worse part is that she tells me again at the end ""he's really just like you, but for some reason I feel bad"" .... 

We're supposed to talk soon, she knows my past and how my ex aborted my daughter, but she doesn't know the full context of it, well that's my story, I do blame myself for not being more assertive but I can't help it, and I thought she understood that after knowing me for 6 years...

"I know I'm not a good person, I hate cheaters and yet here I am falling into the category. Sure.. its a very long term relationship and we're more like roommates than anything these days, but that doesn't excuse that I am emotionally cheating.

I met you while gaming, we instantly hit it off. We quickly fell madly in love with each other, both completely new to this sort of thing, we both felt guilty yet it felt so right at the same time. Your husband started to notice things, you guys began to fight, this caused lots of stress in your life. Your family had health issues on top of that which added to the stress, you became overwhelmed trying to juggle everything - you just didn't quite have the capacity to reciprocate anymore - and thats completely okay.

  
It was hard for you to continue but you couldn't bare to let me go, we both didn't want to let go. I felt guilty and I truly still feel like it was the best choice to let you go to lessen the stress in your life, you couldn't make that decision so I had to for you, we agreed to be friends still and be in each others life but I can't even bare to think about you right now.

I just want to forget... I'm doing this because I love you dearly, more than I've ever loved anyone. I just want to see you happy.. but god damn am I just so sad right now.

"Journal Entry: 2025-11-20 - 16:00

No weird dreams last night, but I lay awake for about two hours, from 3:00 to 5:00 AM. I tried one of the guided meditations from my therapist, but unfortunately, my mind kept wandering to random or negative thoughts.

During dinner last night, I mentioned to my wife 46F that I was going to start therapy because Ive been feeling sad. I feel like maybe mentioning it was a mistake, because she kept asking me why I was stressed or depressed. I didnt want to go into details to avoid hurting her. Even though she was very nice to me about it, I tried to change the subject to how we can help our daughter with her schoolwork.

I feel guilty about my feelings. But I think I eventually need to tell her how I feel about our marriage. Im scared, and I havent made up my mind yetwhether I should keep things as they are and pretend to be happy, or separate and hope that my life could be better.

Im still terrified of losing my kids, my house, my savings, and my income Divorce is scary.

My next meeting with my therapist is on December 16th That feels pretty far away.

I started to get a headache this afternoon; I think its going to rain tomorrow. I took medication, but it didn't kick in at all. As I type this, my anxiety is rising. I feel like I need a big hug, but it feels hypocritical to seek comfort from my wife when I have these feelings.

"I hardly know where to begin. After a failed marriage in my early 20s, I got back out into the dating world and met a man who was very kind to me, spent his free time with me and my two kids, showed up to their events, and made himself a fixture in our lives. After having a child together and living together; things started to arise. 

He stopped being affectionate with me. I hug him, he doesnt hug back. I kiss him, rarely will he kiss back. Never holds my hand or puts his arm around me. Wont cuddle. Having said that, he still takes care of us all, helps around the house, and is affectionate with the children. Ive asked if he just isnt as attracted to me anymore but he states that if he didnt want to be with me hed let me know. But the lack of connection eats at me 

Couple that with a non existent sex life talking once every 2 months and Im struggling. I am a very sexual person and want to be able to enjoy my kinks with someone who is willing to try them and learn what we like together. He refuses anything remotely kinky. He seems almost offended that Im into different things. He is very vanilla, and even with me saying Id help him with whatever fantasy he has, or help him learn some things he rejects it. Im constantly wanting more and he just isnt into it. 

He also nit picks everything I do. I am far from perfect by any means, but If I dont rinse the bubbles out of the sink after washing dishes, I hear about it. If I dont put utensils away to his liking I hear about it. If I dont pick up the dogs mess outside as frequent as he would like me to, he makes remarks. Just seems nothing I ever do is to his standards, even though Im trying so hard to do everything he wants. He calls me a child if I am singing and dancing while cooking, or laughing at something he deems as not funny. 

But he went out of his way to buy a home for all of us to live in, and he helps me with chores, coaches kids sport teams and isnt afraid to help me with anything. He buys me little gifts and tries to be loving, even though it appears to be hard for him. He cares for me, and I him, but we cant seem to get past the intimate side of a relationship. Hell shut down if I even bring it up. 

I cant for the life of me decide if Im doing everyone a disservice by staying and working on things, and damaging each of us in the process and should try again or if finding a man who will care for me, while enjoying my personality, and exploring things is just too much to ask for for a mom of 3 at 30 so I should accept the goodness life has given me","1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1","hardly,affectionate,different,relationship,personality",mixed,fear,"relationship,personality,connection,together,whatever"
"Hi everyone.
Im Darya, Im from Moldova.

Today I want to talk about someone very special  my daughters teacher. Her name is Xenia. Shes only 21, but honestly, she was born for this job. Shes smart, kind, patient, and the kids absolutely adore her.

In Moldova we speak two languages  Russian and Romanian  and its surprisingly hard to find a qualified teacher who speaks Russian. Xenia does. Shes not even from Chiinu, the capital, but somehow we were lucky enough to get her.

My daughter loves her so much. Every morning she asks, Is Xenia there today our kindergarten has a shift system  one teacher in the morning, another in the evening. And all the kids literally run inside when they see her at the door.

Everything would be perfect except for one thing: her salary. She earns around 300 a month. Three hundred. Its insane. You cant live on that here  not with our prices. A coffee costs 2, a simple dress 20, renting a tiny one-bedroom apartment costs about 200 before utilities. Its impossible.

So Xenia is leaving. Shes going abroad to find a better life, and honestly, she deserves it. Shes talented, beautiful, smart  she shouldnt be struggling like this.

But when I found out she was leaving, I cried.
My husband and I talked about this possibility before, but we hoped it wouldnt happen so soon. I was just so happy that this amazing person was the one teaching my daughter. And now shes leaving, and I feel so sad and helpless about it.

What really breaks my heart is that this isnt just her story  its Moldovas story. Salaries are so low that soon there will be no teachers, no doctors, no young specialists left. Those are the foundations of society. And theyre falling apart.

I truly wish Xenia all the happiness she didnt get here. Parents appreciated her. The state didnt.

"2025 November 20: Dear Diary,

Today marks the first new moon since Halloween. Of course I will be meditating and making more moon water, but I must learn how to have more fun in celebrating. It would be very nice to gather friends in order to celebrate the sabbaths and moons. Having like-minded individuals share in the glory of the Universe.  
  
Besides celebrating the new moon, I also picked up some wine today. Beaujolais Nouveau day is today, so I picked up a bottle. I also got a bottle of Madeira as I have never tried it before. George Washington and Thomas Jefferson loved Madeira, so I thought it would be worth a try.  
  
May the Universe bless whoever reads this. The new moon is a time to remember that wherever we are in life it is not permanent. Starting over is not a tragedy, but a blessing. Invite, tonight, wonders you could never believe. For me I am inviting community and more willpower to read and write.

"You'll probably never see this but I want to say...fuck you. It's not because of my overwhelming sadness after you disappeared into the creepiness of our twisted forest, atleast that's what I believe really happened...when in all honesty I have not a clue...they said you passed away but the only thing they could have taken your body to the morg in is the ambulance they insisted I get into and leave just to be taken to the hospital for an hour and picked up by a friend at 4 a.m....they insisted I had to go, I didn't need to go to the psych ward but they insisted, they needed me off the property, that same creepy cop that made sure we didn't get our daughter back last year, the day I believe we really became double hopeless in life, when they showed up, it was one singular officer with no lights on creeping into our driveway, no rush, none at all, told me he had no idea you had shot yourself, wandered into our home  non chalantly as I was still repeating the same sentence I had been repeat for 20 minutes and couldn't catch my breath or stop, comes out and says with no emotion or empathy, ""He's gone, he has no pulse"" that was all. The second Mr. Corruption himself shows up, almost seemed like he was having a good time, he pretends that he doesn't know exactly who the fuck I am but that I just ""look familiar"" so I play his little bullshit game.and pretend I don't know either. Then the coroner and ambulance show, they're trying to look at my neck and I keep telling them I'm fine but they refuse to let me stay inside the house, the house that was nearly empty because we had sold ot 2 days prior. So I follow them out into the freezing cold night air, sobbing uncontrollably, it's like I had no filter of my emotions. I felt like my heart and soul was just ripped from my body stomped on and torn into 3 pieces and put back into my body...I felt it dropping piece by piece into my stomach. 
   
I know things had been draining,..it's fucked up when you feel like your life is some kind of tragic movie and you try so hard and with a positive attitude....sometimes a positive attitude, when you have maybe one tiny thing go right. I feel like we had some kind of script or something and someone else was narrating it and we were made to follow it unknowingly. It was something so sick and twisted, so lacking in empathy from the writer of the story line, it is clear whoever wrote it was a psychopath...I remember you promising me you would never leave me to deal with this awful shit myself and I promised I wouldn't leave you in it either.  My promise still holds strong but you broke yours that night and it has broken me but also taught me so much, made me see things I didn't before, it woke me up to the toxic stuff I was doing, you were not the only one making things worse emotionally for both of us, I was making it worse as well. But I had faith we would make it out stronger because I had loved you since the day I met you in our past lives together,  every single time no one could ever compare and no one ever will. 
    
Onto my main part of this unsent letter....I will now tell you what upsets me and angers me more than anything about what you did. You didnt just devastate me, our daughter has went through way too much and you just had to be so fucking self consumed or self deprecating that you just threw in the towel not even considering her. I had my visit with her today, had to borrow my friends car to go there since I have no vehicle thanks to your family and an old friend who I knew was a snake and went against my intuition which I always regret, you mentioned this person a few weeks prior to that night. Our daughter wants to Come home so badly it's literally killing me inside, that poor little angel, I start tearing up thinking about it. I know i would have gotten her back at the last court hearing if I had a stable living situation but unfortunately every person that has hurt you, not shown up for you emotionally or even came around at all when it was us against the world. The original abandoners think they're entitled to what you left for me and our daughter. As you had mentioned prior, that you thought your family was working with our daughters paternal side of the family, you were absolutely right as well as your old boss and you last wonderful ex and our long time friend and her significant other. They don't want our daughter,  they only want her so I can't have her and they get money. You know she needs to come home, she hates it there.  How fuckong dare you leave like you did, not giving a flying fuck what would happen in the aftermath,  you had to have known that all those many assholes would pop their greedy heads out feeling special and entitled. That is the thing that passes me off the most is you left not me but HER here to go through more pain She loves you so much, you were her daddy, no one else ONLY YOU And you still are the only daddy. So fuck you   yep first and last name Because you love being called that so very much just like I love the fact that I'm going to be alone for the rest of my life because my person abandoned me and also I have to figure what seems like a million things out to make sure OUR little girl comes home to me. I will not give up, the assholes who thought they had the right tondo whatever they felt they wanted to are about to find out how they made me even stronger and I will not quit until every injustice is corrected. They will see
   
 So my dear ghost of my soul partner, use your spirit or whatever to help me get our baby home I  love you,  you know it, dont talk your crazy shit. You know you're the only fucking person for me. So thanks, maybe I'll score the scene like on the movie Ghost....yeah right, couldn't het that lucky

I can't help but think of a time where I embrassed myself in front of a man who wasn't interested me and told me that he does not want to talk to me anymore. This happened last year. This is due attachment issues and limerence which I have been working on through therapy and I have been feeling a bit better than last year. The worst thing I did was compare myself to their partner and it reinforced negative perceptions of myself such as being uglier. She is more prettier than me lighter skinned, Skinner and her partner is white and reinforce negative perceptions of myself being a darker skinned curver woman 
 
For context :this one case happened in April this year: I interacted with a person I knew but had not chatted with since August last year. To give context, I had developed romantic feelings for him after a week of knowing him but was left heartbroken after discovering that he had a partner. Despite this, I thought in my mind that I could still be friends with him. A few weeks passed, and I noticed that he became more cold, distant, and aloof towards me. This was evident the one time I wanted to talk to him in private to apologize for pulling his bag. He refused to talk to me and ignored me when I was merely being nice to him.

So that day, I thought maybe I could greet him. I did, and he was still aloof and cold to me. I asked why he was acting that way, and he replied that he did not want to talk to me. I asked what I did that made him so angry, but he wouldn't give me an answer. I tried to reason with him and apologized frequently if I did anything that hurt him or people he knew, but to no avail. I went back to my residence and cried for 4 hours, became sick.","1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1","flashbacks,attachment,perceptions,wouldn,residence",negative,anger,"attachment,limerence,residence,prettier,partner"

Truly I'm sorry for letting you down in all the ways i did. You were the best lover and friend and companion i ever had..

I'm sorry I couldn't face my fears and get sober for us. I'm still trying my best.

Shes now single but maybe currenrly talking to one of my guy friends. Anyways her friend told me she found one of our old messages as notes etc and was remiscing back and cry and told her friw d which she relayed to me. Keep in mind i already forgotten her. I hated her for dotching me and talking to my friend. I now disregarded both of them. No im not looking back.

So of course ima be pissed asf at her. 
We didnt even get to talk about emding anything. It was straight up silence and ignore. I suffocated for 4-5months asking why. Anyways her friends ask if i ever look ar her when i walk by. I said no, if i know where she will be i dared not look. Her friend tells me well do you know that she looks at you when your not looking. I said okay. Sure. It doesnt matter. What she thinks and do doesnt matter now. All i see is her and my so called friend flirting. I just tell her friend to tell her throw everything away as i already did.

"2025-11-19 - 20:00

Today I 44M woke up at 5:00, alone in my bed. My wife 46F was sleeping with our daughter 10F because our daughter couldnt fall back asleep.

I dreamt again of a separation. I am still very conflicted about my feelings. I kept thinking about the dream and couldn't get back to sleep. In the dream, we had a friendly separation and were both happy in our own separate ways. The kids understood, and we were still able to talk about their education.

I know it is a dream and not reality. I dont want to hurt my wife, and if we did break up, Im afraid that she would be both sad and angry, and might try to hurt me. I still care about her.

My therapist told me that reality is 10 truth and 90 illusionthat my feelings might not be ""real."" I am confused about it. I need to look into this and read the documentation he gave me.

My wife left to drive our son to school, so I was alone with my daughter. We talked about her upcoming exam and how ready we were for it. Last night I helped her study for her history exam and I genuinely had a good time with her.

She asked me to check if her report card had arrived. While I hadn't received an email, I checked the parent portal to see if it was there. I told her I would wait until tonight to print it and show her. I knew the grades wouldn't be great; the exams she made us sign recently were poor, so it was expected.

My son 12M received his report card too, and it was very good in my opinion. However, I was stressed most of the day because I dreaded my wifes reaction to our daughter's report card. I checked it, and it was indeed very disappointing. Once I built up the courage to tell her, I printed it out. We talked about it and discussed how we could help our daughter. I must say, I am proud of how it went because we were both very calm.

When my daughter came home, the discussion with her went well. I could feel my wife losing patience, but I used a calm voice to try and align the discussion with more positivity. There were multiple times where I felt like my wife wanted to get angry, but I managed to keep the conversation calm.

Later, my wife asked my mom for her passport, and it stressed me out. I am afraid to commit to the trip to Europe right away. I feel like if I do, I will be forced to stay in this relationship and won't have any other options. I need to convince her not to buy the tickets before the New Year so that I can at least sort out my feelings.

I have a stomach ache tonight and feel like I might be getting a headache. I will try to go to bed early.

I will try to write tomorrow","1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1","today,afraid,daughter,parent,family,conversation,passport,relationship,tomorrow",mixed,sadness,"documentation,conversation,relationship,separation,discussion"

"2025 November 19: Dear Diary,

I am not an atheist, but sometimes it feels like it. Trusting in the process is hard, but it feels the best when I can. It is really awesome when I can be a person that I like being. I love being jovial, funny, confident, and compassionate. A lot of the times I come off as awkward and nervous, and I worry how people view this.  
  
I act as though I have been traumatized and perhaps I may have been. It feels like people could turn on me at any moment and I would be none the wiser. Of course this is not how I want to think or behave. It is much better to trust that I can be the wonderful person I envision myself as. Trusting the process is necessary for this to occur.

"I dont have her picture, not her voice,
not the warmth of her beside me.
All I have is a pen she forgot in class
a small, ordinary thing
that smells like her softness,
her presence, her quiet.

I kept it.
Not because I couldnt return it,
but because it became the last piece of her
I could hold without breaking.

Some nights I press it between my fingers,
and it almost feels like holding her hand
not really,
but close enough for a heart
that has learned to live on almost.

This pen
it doesnt write words,
it writes memories:
her laughter, her calm,
the way she made my storms quiet
without even trying.

And maybe thats why
I never gave it back.
Because everything else slipped away
her voice, her presence, her light
but this pen stayed.

Neither her love nor this pen is mine,
but this is something she once touched,
I can hold this as a memory of her,
and as a reminder that she was here once,
close enough to touch,
close enough to change me,
close enough to leave

Im not going to have anyone there for me

"Hey everyone,
Recently Ive been having these thoughts like what if I had been born a girl and it kind of surprised me. The more I sat with that idea, the more I realized it brings up some complicated feelings for me  some curiosity, some confusion, and honestly, some excitement.

I want to be clear: I enjoy dating women and Im not questioning that. But Ive started wondering what it would be like to explore a more feminine side of myself, even if its just virtually or emotionally. Im not sure what this means for me identity-wise, and Im not making any big declarations  just trying to understand myself better.

So I guess Im wondering:
		Has anyone else gone through something like this
		How did you explore these feelings safely and honestly
		And is there a space or community where people are open to talking or even virtually dating in a more feminine vibe, just to see how it feels
		Or maybe I just need a friend to explore the concept with  someone who gets it.

Any advice, support, or perspective would mean a lot. Thanks for reading. ","1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0",everyone,positive,none,"excitement,curiosity,confusion,community,identity"

"M28 I need to vent all the mess I have inside, I don't know if writing it will help me but it will certainly be better than pretending not to feel it.
The last relationship I was in destroyed me, and when I say destroyed I mean literally; try to imagine breaking a mirror and seeing yourself fragmented.
It's been two months now, she's blocked me from all sides, left me by message and told me that I'm just a useless distraction for her.
I'm not a toxic person either in behavior or intentions, I'm really a piece of bread, a good guy.
I fell in love with her because I saw her as ""broken and depressed"", having been through it myself previously, I wanted to give her smile back... during the entire time we were together I was the victim of psychological violence over and over again, starting from ghosting and ending up always being to blame for everything, even the end of our relationship... As I was different from her, not having parents and not being exactly right for her.
It's the first time someone treated me like a toy... Used me and then abandoned me.
I have my blemishes too, of course... I started the relationship with her when I was still living at home with my ex, but after a year of separation we remained roommates and on good terms, so much so that we decided to continue living together to save money.
She saw this very badly and continued to throw it in my face for the entire duration of our relationship, to the point of making me live with a sense of guilt that I couldn't swallow.
It is also true that we only had a double bed at home and on a single occasion I slept on the bed, instead of on the sofa very uncomfortable, with my roommate next to me, from 4 in the morning to 7, because then we would leave for a day at the water park... I'll start by saying that I went to sleep at 4 because I spent the night preparing food for the next day.
I also add the fact that I used to smoke joints every now and then, and she just didn't accept it... now I can't even smell them anymore, and I did it to sleep because I suffer from insomnia, my brain thinks at an exaggerated pace and sometimes the thoughts don't let me close my eyes.
Before breaking up we had decided to go to Rome, because we both want to study veterinary medicine, only that I, for truly absurd reasons, was unable to enroll and get the scholarship... now I find myself without plans for the future, with a constant feeling of vomiting that doesn't leave me; every time something makes me nervous my body instinctively leads me to vomit, without a home because I moved away from the house I had with my roommate. Now I live with my brother but he doesn't clean, he doesn't nothing inside the house and he expects me to clean his ass too

He was ..is a playboy . Talks to many girls,  goes out on many dates pretty experienced . And even im but only on texts not that much like him irl . So after talking for 1 month I deactivate my insta due to exams.  And still i texted him a goodbye msg and all saying let's go on a date fs some day  and Dropped my phone no. We didn't talked for 2 months.  But the day when my exam was done he texted me on wp . We started talking again.  But then gone ..for weeks or months . Me talking with many guys and him doing the same . We forget abt eachother.  We have a great sexual chemistry.  Bdsm and shit. Then he comes back ..this time we talked on calls . And then things got dark ..me telling him abt my dad cheating , and many more things ..this time the dynamic changed . We talked ..then again vanished . Neither I texted , or call or cling to him what are we ...I do absolutely nothing. And then again vanish ..for 2 moths ..I live my life , he lives his and then comes back . This cycle is going on from Feb..and now its nov . Today he called me spilled some tea , gossip , bitches , playboy, talked dirty  shit and i did the same. And I never go back to him ..never. he comes ..we talk ..vanish ..idk what's going on between us .

"TW: Suicide 

I am supposed to type something

I am angry today.

I thought of jumping from the 9th floor. How peaceful the jump must feel. But then it's the landing that kills you, not the fall. It's an attractive option. 

I hate everyone. I understand why they do it. But do they ever not learn to step on someone's nerves and respectfully fuck off.

I am not a bad person. I hope not. 

I have hurt people, but that was in the way of healing myself. I must make peace with the fact that someone will always get hurt when I heal. 

I must get back to my feet and vibe back to my tempo, for a storm awaits tommorow. Healing can wait. People can wait. 

One of these days this anxiety will fucking kill me. If that won't my internalized guilt will. My fucking body feels like a corpse. 

I don't know if anyone can relate. If anyone can, I am so sorry. Please reach out so I won't feel like I am the only one.

"I feel like no matter how hard I try to be the woman you say you want beside you, its never enough.
We share a home, and I move through it trying to soften your life in the ways I know how.
When you shower, your night clothes are already waiting.
When you game, I bring your food to you, telling you to relax, Ill take care of it, even when I am the one worn thin.
When youre done, I clear your plates, even if the sink waits for me longer than it should because my body is tired from days that never give me rest.

You point out the one thing I didnt do, the one moment I wasnt perfect.
You say you cant live like this every day, as if the days Ive poured into you dont count.
As if laying out your work clothes, leaving granola bars for your rushed mornings, and smoothing the small edges of your world all fade because I missed a patch of dust in the corner.

And still, I dont go out, because you dont like the version of me that surfaces after a few shots of tequila.
You dont like when my laughter gets too loud, or when the tiredness slips off my shoulders long enough for me to feel light again.
The night I went out with my team, you were annoyed that I came back a little tipsy, smiling too brightly, laughing too freely.
In your eyes, even in that moment, I failed you.
All I wanted was a few hours to let my hair down, to feel alive in a way that didnt involve serving or shrinking myself.
But somehow wanting joy made me wrong.

And somehow, your mood becomes my fault.
Somehow, my effort becomes invisible.
Somehow, I become the weight on your chest instead of the hands lifting it.

So I ask myself why am I never enough

"I feel like a stranger in my own life.

I do not know what is wrong with me. I cannot explain why I feel like this. Why everything feels heavy. Why my chest aches even when nothing is happening. Sometimes I feel like I am drifting through life like a stranger people glance at but never really see. Maybe that hurts more than being invisible. Being seen in all the wrong ways.

I keep wondering if I did something to end up here. Did I push people away. Did they leave on their own. I honestly do not know anymore. My memories change on me. One day I remember laughter. The next day it feels like it never happened. Even my reflection does not feel like it belongs to me. She blinks first. She looks tired. I cannot tell which one of us is lying.

I tell myself I am fine but I do not believe it. The silence inside me is louder than anything. And when the voices show up they make more sense than I do. At least they stay. At least they do not leave without a word.

I try to anchor myself in small harmless things. Puzzles. Painting. Quiet tasks that keep my hands busy so my thoughts do not swallow me. I piece colors together because maybe if I can make something whole, I will remember what it feels like to be whole myself. But even then it feels hollow. Like I am building a life out of scraps hoping one day the picture makes sense.

I do not know who I am anymore. I do not know what I am waiting for. Love feels like a locked door I cannot knock on again. Happiness feels like something I missed my chance at. I feel heartbroken without anyone left to blame. Lost without a map. Haunted by questions I cannot even put into words.

I keep asking myself why I feel like this. Why I cannot be okay. Why I laugh at pain like it is some inside joke. Why I cry alone until the walls sound worried. I still do not have the answers. Maybe I never will.

Is it bad that I want to cry even if nothing is necessarily wrong Is it wrong that I cant help but feel suffocated by my own thoughts and anxiety I cant put a finger on what has been so wrong, but I cant seem to pull myself out. I want him to touch me but I jerk away every time or deter him. Why am I pushing away something I want Do I not want it I feel like I do but its like Im rejecting him constantly.



I want to be alone and isolated but when I go home I am surrounded. I feel like Im slowly becoming more in my shell than Ive ever been. Im very social, so why does talking to people drain me so much

  
Why do I crave things I cant stand I crave being with others but at the same time I cant stand being constantly surrounded.



Im scared to cry but I fear Im already on my way. 



I feel like Im doing a lot of cleaning and work but everything is still incomplete and messy. What is wrong with me Im so tired even though Im sleeping. Im so bored with myself. I feel like Im bed rotting but I know Im not. I feel like Im running marathons with the weight of the world on my shoulders but Im not.



Im tired. So very very tired.



I want to go home. I dont want to do anything else. Im dreading so many things. Sure some major things suck but somehow, its the small shit thats getting under my skin this bad.



I want to confront that stalker guy. I think his name might be Gael. Hes been stalking me and I feel uneasy whenever hes nearby. I think that unease is causing my anxiety to spiral further. Im more stressed about the fact that I cant speak up when hes around rather than the fact that hes fucking stalking me. Crazy right Right. I think Im fucking losing it.



Im stressed about normal shit. Im working mad hard for the VA to give me my educational benefits, and my mom had to take out a loan for me so I could get money. I am struggling way more than I believed I would be in college. I thought I would be getting benefits to go with my refund every month and yet Im slowly dwindling out of money because I have too much anxiety to drive. Im trying so damn hard to get over all this bullshit.



Its even harder without a therapist to talk to. I am in constant unease by my own shit. I always feel like when Im having a good time my depression and anxiety kind of just attack me.

  
I dont want meds to fuck up my liver. I already have enough problems brewing. I just want peace, but I fear I may not be comfortable with peace.



I think Im making problems out of nothing, but I dont know how to stop. What can I even do I cant afford therapy. I can barely afford to eat or get drinks from the vending machine. 



I feel like I can be myself with my boyfriend but I also feel like I might be too much. I still get really nervous with him which Im mostly open about. What if Im too loud or too clingy What if Im too talkative or I start really annoying him Sure, I can easily get over him being a little annoying sometimes, but this is my first real relationship. I had my first kiss with him, told him things I dont tell people. Not romantically at least. Ive been very open. Hes a great person and I refuse to hide my personality but what if it gets to be too much What if he doesnt know how to tell me I DID tell him that he has to tell me or I wont stop but how would one comfortably go about that



I wish I could be with him more. I talk more about him than I do to him which isnt anyones fault but it sucks. Man, what if he doesnt like my Christmas gift I think its cute but what if hes not into it That would fucking suck. Its a couples bracelet which means I would wear one half. What if hes not super into it and Im just a dumbass with two bracelets I dont want to wear something meaningful and Im wearing both meanings.



What if one person loves the other more What if I love him more than he loves me I really love him. A lot. I know he loves me too especially since he said it first but what if I only seem too much because Im feeling too hard It is still kind of early.



I have fears of breaking up. I dont want to be alone, and I dont want him to just be a friend. Weve talked about the event of us breaking up but I feel like I couldnt be his friend after. Id have a lot of feelings and thoughts after. He said he would still be my friend which is nice but I dont know if I could do it. I dont want to have to make that choice either.



I want to be with him for as long as we can be. I want to one day move in with him. Maybe even marriage far into the future. I dont want to think about breakups. Just us being happy even well into our 30s. I know, being in your 30s is still really young but that relationship is pretty long.



I dont like these spirals but it feels like I cant escape them sometimes. I know I experienced a spiral back in August or September before much was even happening. I was crying myself to sleep without reason. I couldnt put a reason to my depression, but it was something I was dealing with heavily.



Is it kind of narcissistic that I want to hear my recorded songs Just for the vibes of them. Even though half of them are stories and not real, the feelings I put in them are real. Some songs dont even have lyrics yet make me feel like Im back in a moment where I felt trapped by my familial trauma.



Sometimes I feel like Im still tied down by them. Like Im chained under water and dont know it. Im swimming upward mind you I cant swim and right before I get my head out, I feel the chain stopping me. 



I miss poetry and miss small internet series I never posted. I wrote a lot of my writing when I was mentally suffering the most. Maybe I can use that and this journal as that output. Reading that stuff back and even hearing some of my old music really reminds me how dark my mind was and how little I believed I could escape. Ive been in a dark place my whole life. Its not surprising I keep falling back into this shit.



See you again, journal. Maybe tomorrow, maybe during my next spiral.

"So I am sitting here being kind of a low life. And I hate that I am doing it. But what choice do I have left. If I have another episode like I did last night.And this morning, i'm gonna really fuck up.Somebody's life do major damage to them.Their reputation their livelihood..... And that is, in fact, the last thing I want to do. My diseases are winning. My mental state is sometimes it feels like it doesn't even exist anymore. Always in a melting state.

I can numb it and feel fine by using drugs. But I don't want to use the drugs except when I do.And it becomes too much so there isn't, I still catch22. Wait, that's not a catch twenty two, it kind of proves my point.I was actually smart once upon a time........

 But why am I a low life right now .Easy.

I am sitting outside her place of employment, hoping she will do the right thing.And give me those five seconds of eye contact. I mean she keeps showing the world how much she loves me by doing this.And it's like she doesn't even see it while she's trying to get everybody to believe that she doesn't love me. Last I checked, that's simple psychology.Onehttp:psychology.One on one like fifth grade shit. But once again what do I know. At times though I know a lot. Given the melting and burning sensation going on not burning, but burning.If that makes sense in my brain right now, I don't know a lot.

  
I know it is more and more suffocating.Ashttp:suffocating.As every second passes up there knowing that she wants me to hurt so bad because of what I did, which I have not kept secret.There are plenty of posts about that.And I am getting to a point where I finally remember it.I think my psyche couldn't handle it.Which, once again other polish will explain that.That's how this whole journey started.....

  
I absolutely fucking hate that.I am sitting out here like this.And it's not because I want to be like she's making me sit out here

  
No, it's because i've become that fucking desperate to hold on to my slipping.Mind.... to keep my wits about me that I have resorted to this...

  
Now, anybody that's been reading my post.Y'all know I love her, but I don't think I ever clarified that whenever those times that I was like, hey, yeah, that's me.Let's I love her with all my heart.I would not get with her right now.There are so many trust issues between us.I would do counseling with her.I would not be with her right now. And I did try to kind of make that subtly known with the I want to date you.... If she read it, she would understand that dating and being together two completely different meanings whenever I use them, so I will clarify for everybody else..... The insinuation was intended to be there that I don't want to live with her.I don't want to be with her as that, but I do want to get to know her see if we can build trust...

See if there is a chance at our future...

  
But instead after so, many failed, attempts of getting her  to, be decent because she feels wronged And if I have this right to do that, she's fucking was the one feeding her All these lies that she believed to be real when she chose to go no contact... Which I don't not opposeNo contact for me depends on the situation.And in ours, all it did was cause more harm than good.... Now overall, I am very anti no contact, and I will happily have an educated debate with anybody about it.Athttp:it.At any given time because I am more knowledgeable on the subject than most people who claim to be professionals due to my lovely home environment, growing up is a little kid.... Y'all were excited about reading outsiders, and I just got a couple hundred more pages of this new psych review.... It hurts my head saying that cause when the fuck did I go into eighth gradeI am thirty nine years old...... 

  
Well, I have given her an hour to try to do the right thing.Instead, i'm sure she's just having her feet, wait on the cops to come

  
It will be the most peaceful arrest ever for them from me

  
Can't be mad at them for doing their job

But that is how desperate I have become for Supatcha to do the right thing.

  
And since I didn't cover it too deeply on this post. No, I do not think people should rely on other people to fix your issues. There are a fuck ton of mitigating circumstances around this one.And me asking her for this, I already kind of was.I didn't know why though, but oh therapist, dude kind of broke it down for me, and I get to be one of those lucky few rare ones said, with no enthusiasm because who wants to rely on another fucking human when you know, all they do is fuck each other over","1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0","kind,gonna,keeps,understand,family,desperate",mixed,excitement,"insinuation,environment,reputation,livelihood,employment"

I came here to study. Funny how life mocks you: the expert on keeping families together just lost her own fianc two weeks before flying out.
My fianc, Amir ended it over a calm, eight-second voice note. Fourteen months of wedding plans, gone. I was thirty-five, newly single, and boarding a plane to a city Id only ever seen on Google Earth.

Now i dont particularly respect women either but I do respect and like them a significant amount more than I respect or like men.

I everytime I tell someone I dont really respect men they treat me like a man hating lesbian I am not a man hating lesbian or when it comes to men about half the time i get some sort of vague threat usually rape and that has nothing to do with my lack of respect for men but it sure doesn't help. There is no true reason why I dont respect men, I just dont. Im not going to defend it or try to make it make any sort of sense of it. I just dont respect men.

And once more I am not a man hating lesbian, im not even a lesbian, I mean i am attracted to women, but I think im more pansexual and like gender doesn't matter to me but I do prefer submissiveness because I just dont find dominance attractive in any way I just think its annoying and mildly disgusting. I feel like no matter how many times i say it people dont believe me when i say i dont hate men, i have no animosity for them i just dont, I dont hate men, I never have, I never will.","1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0",misandrist,neutral,none,"submissiveness,dominance,animosity,stronger,smarter"
"2025 November 18: Dear Diary,

There is but one poema I can consider to be the most true and tragic and that is Sylvia Plaths parable of the fig tree. The reality of her poem is apparent, every choice that we make will eliminate all the choices we do not. This tragedy overwhelms me leaving me in a tantalizing despair.  
  
The fact that I can not learn every language I have the desire to learn is disheartening. Seeing all of the people online who I would like to be friends with or love but can not leaves me disappointed. Knowing that I can not help everybody who needs help breaks me. And witnessing all the unnecessary cruelty of human beings leaves me despising the hominid family.

Resentment is not the cure though. Hatred only breeds a corruption of the soul. Though it is tempting to hate, and is perhaps the only logical conclusion to witnessing human beings, misanthropy is unproductive. Instead of hating humans or focusing on all of the actions we would like to take but can not, we should focus on what we love about the world and live with patience.

I am reminded of a dream that I had a few years ago. In this dream a branch of a cherry blossom tree broke off and I wanted to take a petal to keep. My dad told me to wait for him to take off all the petals so I could have a branch full instead of just one. When I woke up from the dream I ripped a page off of the calendar and the next page had a cherry blossom picture with Ecclesiastes 3:22 written under it. So I saw that there is nothing better for a person to enjoy their work, because that is their lot. For who can bring them to see what will happen after them

I saw, and still see, this dream as a prophecy of some kind. Patience will feel like a curse, but will bring all of the petals instead of a few. Maybe I can only pick one fig, but at least I can have a branch full of cherry blossom petals.

Sincerely,

Torinico","1,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0","november,eliminate,friends,family,patience,instead,work",positive,affection,"resentment,corruption,conclusion,november,consider"

"2025 November 17: Dear Diary,

It has been better to act naturally. Sometimes I have no idea what I am doing. The trauma of being raised Autistic in the United States leaves an impression on you. It is an impression where you think you are doing things wrong, but you can never be sure what.  
  
I know I am not doing anything wrong. Any attempt to try and make me feel bad about it is just poor gaslighting, which is a favourite activity of neurotypicals not all, just a great amount. Everything I do is done with compassion for other people, even if they do not deserve it.  
  
The only times I have acted out of, what can be considered, cruelty is when I was defending myself. It is my responsibility to break free of societal gaslighting and embrace my true self that wants to spread kindness. It does not matter if people think I am not genuine and try to harass me because of their myopic worldview. What only matters is that I can make a change, even a slight one, on the world.  
  
Sincerely,

We've been together since 2017, married since 2021, and I'm falling out of love with him. I'm not interested in physical intimacy with him, the thought actually makes me feel like I'm doing something wrong, and until a few months back, I've been forcing myself to sleep with him. We work the same schedule and have the same days off so it's not like we don't spend time together but I don't want to be with him when I'm off work. I've even been sleeping in the guest room for privacy and to just be away from him. I've compared us to roommates that share a room but we don't even share a room. I told him I don't like the mattress and he kicks me off the bed which wasn't a complete lie and he bought a new mattress and tried changing our sleep positions so he can't kick me off. The mattress is better but I still don't want to sleep in the same bed as him. I took over our guest room, moved my clothes and pillow over and only go in there when I need to do anything bedroom adjacent.

Now for the part that makes me more of a monster than I feel just for staying; I do OF on the side he's aware and sometimes I talk to these guys outside OF and send them extras for a small fee on top of my regular content. He's aware of these conversations and pictures as long as it stays financial. But on top of these ""boyfriends,"" I've also been in contact with an old friend, also an ex of mine, who started out as a ""boyfriend"" and later turned into a confidant. We talked about my marriage, my emotions, my problems, as well as his marriage, interests, emotions and problems. Eventually we started talking romantically. I tell my husband he's just one of my ""boyfriends"" and he leaves it alone. He's told me a divorce is the only thing left, be honest with my husband and don't leave him wondering.

We're moving into my parents old house currently with my sister and her son. With all of us in one house, there is only enough room for the two of us to take the largest, the master bedroom. If we divorced, there wouldn't be room for the four of us to have separate rooms, and my parents mortgage company would only lease it to us since we have different last names and are a couple. I don't want to make him move back with his parents for his own personal reasons so it feels like I'm stuck. I'm not happy living with him, not happy married to him, not happy living in this town and not happy with my life. I've told him the second half because I don't want to hurt him but I think I'm hurting him more by ignoring the first part.

I know I'm being completely selfish and only caring about myself but I've been stressing about things for him and about him since we first got together and not worrying about me for so long, I don't know who I am outside of his wife. I already feel terrible for thinking and feeling this way but I'm not happy anymore. But I can't tell him.. I love him but I'm not in love with him.","1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1","somewhere,together,work,adjacent,sometimes,conversations,boyfriends,family,love",positive,happiness,"together,monster,better,sister,master"
"It might sound like Im desperate. Hell, I might be. Desperate for love, for someone to belong to, who in return will give themself to me. And no, I dont just want anybody, but I do believe that I could love just about anybody. To me, its not about looks, though I dont pretend there shouldnt be some attraction. Ofcourse it matter.

But I could start a chat with someone, without seeing them first, and I could commit to that person. I want deeper talks, conversations where we really get to know eachother, all with the knowledge, that we are commited to one another. I want, and I think I need that security. I am getting so tired of starting chats with people, just for it to stop. I feel drained. 

Cant we just agree to be together 
I like you and find you interesting, you like me and find me interesting, so let us build on that. Sure, we might end up going our separate ways, but until then, let us commit. Let us be a real couple, loving, loyal and fully commited to get to know eachother. No looking for other options while we do this. I dont need you to promise me forever, though I would love it if you did. I just need you to promise me, that while we do this, you are all in. No holding back, and no escape plan. Let us take our time, just focusing on eachother. 

I dont like this dating game, and sometimes I wish I was born in a culture with arranged marriages. I know I would be a good, loving, loyal and caring man. I love fully, with all of my heart, and I my heart dont wander. I am not interested in getting to know a lot of people, only on the surface. I want to know one, completely and fully. I want to us to belong to eachother, no games, no worrying if they are gonna leave, because something new and excited came along. I want us to have time. Time to really delwe deep down in eachother. I wanna know her childhood and what made her, hr. I want to know her fears, what makes her happy, and her dreams. I want to know it all. I want to stand by her side through everything that life throws at her, and I want to know that she will stand by me. I want to see her succeed, come home to me and share her joy. I want it ALL

I am getting too old or games, for wasting my time, but it feels like it is all that I do. Wasting time and energy on getting to know someone, opening up, just for them to stop responding, or telling me they have too much going on. 
And the thing is, I know its not me, well, maybe sometimes. But it feels like people are just waiting someone to entertain them for a short while, just to find the next plaything. What happened to commitment What happened to people wanting a real relationship, surrendering to duality.

"Final stopBoston Please check your seats and gather all belongings. If this is your destination, we thank you for riding with us.

I stayed in my seat, stretching my legs out into the aisle, rolling my shoulders back. My eyes felt like theyd been glued open for five days straight. Everyone else shuffled past mebumping bags against seat backs, muttering to each other, rushing toward that open door like they were escaping a prison. I let them go. I wanted to be last so I could take my time, grab my bag from the overhead without someones elbow in my ribs.

The front door of the bus hissed open and cold air shot down the aisle like someone had opened a freezer. I could feel it on my face, in my lungs. Sharp. Biting. Real.

When everyone finally cleared out, I stood up, grabbed my backpack, and made my way to the front. The bus driver handed me my suitcase from the storage underneaththis red burgundy thing with shiny loop belt locks that looked fancy but werent. One of them was already broken, so the damn thing could pop open if I wasnt careful. I thanked him and stepped off onto the pavement.

The cold hit me like a slap.

I stood there for a minute, just outside the terminal doors, and took a deep breath in. The air was so cold it burned going down. When I exhaled, I could see my breaththick and white, floating away like smoke. Everything was sparkly. Foggy. The streetlights made the falling snow look like glitter. Id never seen real snow before. Not like this. Not snow that stayed on the ground and piled up and made everything quiet and clean.

I looked down at what I was wearingwindbreaker, thin hoodie, T-shirt underneath. California clothes. I might as well have been naked.

I ran inside.

The terminal was quiet. A few vending machines hummed against the far wall. People were scattered here and theresleeping on benches, waiting with their coats bunched up as pillows. There was a ticket counter to my left, but nobody behind it. A family near the door, picking up someone who looked just as tired as I felt. They hugged, grabbed bags, and left. Then it was just the stragglers. Just the hum of fluorescent lights and the occasional cough echoing off the walls.

I spotted a payphone in the corner. The cord was hanging loose, twisting slowly, catching the light like it was dancing. Almost glitching, I think.

I dragged my suitcase overclunk clunk clunk on the tileand propped it against the wall. The broken lock meant I had to keep it close, keep an eye on it. But the terminal was practically empty, and I was right there. Nobody was going to mess with it.

I picked up the receiver, dropped in the coins. Plunk. Plunk.

It rang twice.

Hello. The voice was short. Demanding. Not mad, justabrupt. Like she had better things to do.

Im here. At the bus terminal.

Okay. Be right there. Click.

That was it.

I hung up and stood there for a second, staring at the payphone. Then I walked over to the vending machines, dug out some change, and got myself a drink and a candy bar. I didnt even look at what kind. I just pressed buttons and took what came out.

Then I walked. Paced, really. Around the terminal. Past the benches. Past the bathrooms. Back to the vending machines. But never too far from my suitcasealways keeping it in view, that broken lock like a little red flag saying dont trust me. I kept looking out the big windows at the snow falling under the streetlights.

I dont know how long I waited. Probably an hour, maybe more. Revere to Boston isnt a quick trip.

But I wasnt tired anymore. Five days of sleeping sitting up, clutching my bag, watching every person who walked pastfive days of that, and somehow now I felt awake. Refreshed. Like Id been holding my breath the entire ride and finally let it out. Standing there in that quiet terminal, watching the snow fall outside, I felt something I hadnt felt in a long time.

"Growing up I was not exposed to marriage or romantic relationships. More than just immediate family but including extended family as well. Yes there were kids, out of wedlock, but just kids to me because most of us depended on one parent. Even as I got older and was exposed to dynamics outside of my family the single mother dynamic seemed to be the norm. 

There is only one married couple with whom I've had consistent interaction with or observed interacting with each other. With that exposure to romantic relationships or lack thereof I still tend to to find myself desiring and yearning for something I have never seen. 

Obviously how you grow up and what you are exposed to plays a role in wants and desires in your later years, indoctrination type shit. It takes a village to raise a child so society at large potentially plays a role in said desires.

I think it would leave a lot to be desired if i proceeded without working through my gender biases and indoctrination of someone who is stereotypically male because although the model for romantic pairing wasn't there in person it does not mean that certain notions of what having been born with the specific set of genitalia mean when it comes to interacting with the subject of desire. It seems to be a recurring theme and I lowkey hate it because it starts to feel less like I am actively working to try and minimise the harm of my indoctrination but rather using it as tool in attempt to make myself look better. 

there isn't an explicit course of  what is expected of you by others who ascribe to ideas of there being binaries and that these binaries hold meaning that is concrete. Hence, i don't know where in i have adopted notions of masculinity or patriarchy as it pertains to romantic relationships. The overwhelming message seems to be you grow up you find a woman you like, get married and have kids. This message is accompanied by unspoken expectations of what attributes you are to have that will deem you entitled to a wife by your fellow men. how much of my desire to be an individual who commits to be an active part of contributing to a relationship stems from the indoctrination of if you aren't desire by women for your masculinity you are less than or from the absorption of the stereotypes that woman ought to be nurturing and that is where i can finally express some vulnerability without ridicule.

Id like to think as i continuously work to shed myself of the parts that are harmful to me and those i wish to initiate budding romance with i am aware of the harm i pose. We are said to be social creatures and after the physiological and safety needs comes love and belonging so the desire for companionship is human. I just don't understand why it seems that i want to fulfil this need through romantic relations. 

Id assume it has to do with a lot of the media i have consumed i don't really know. The desire to be desirable exhausts me. It being desirable is something that I wish i had the care of an absent dad for. Do i wish i was more, definitively, with the wish is the reminder that i am not which results in unprecedented levels of self-consciousness. the desire to be a partner to someone is engulfing but you can't be a mate to someone if they do not have a desire for you.  these are not sour grapes, my want to be desirable to a sect wont turn me sour if said sect does not deem as. 


With that all said, Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs goes from most to least important 1. Physiological needs, 2. Safety and security, 3. Love and Belonging, 4. Self-esteem and 5. Self-actualization so it always pisses me off when people state that ""no one will love you before you love yourself"" or ""you are insecure you should love yourself more"". I am no scientist nor philosopher but it seems that before i can have a love for myself i need to receive it from others before i can get to the point of self-esteem. 


Delving further into the desire, it's not simply desire to desire, desire because there is gain, not that there isn't but it's not just receiving but also serving. It's common on twitter for the rebuttal to be 'but weren't you in my dms' which is comical because guys don't do to well with rejection so much so that labeling it only comical is down playing the seriousness that is probable and that a simple 'uh no thank you i am not interested in your advances' potentially could result in harm. its an issue shouldn't be taken lightly nor brushed past. 

i can assume where the act of compliment others became something that you should refrain from. if you compliment someone that gives them  a lot of hold over you in that at any point it could be used as ridicule against the complimentor "" you said my knees, scrapes and all ought to be kept in a safe at the kink museum, but this is how you are acting now "" granted if you act right it wont come to that. i want to be able find someone with their presenceaccentaesthetic stimulating just because that's how it is, unchained of the "" weren't you just gassing me a minute ago"" possibility when i dont agree with a point of view ""you"" shared,  not that i mind because yes i was and it still stands true the duality of man or some shit like that, the dynamics around developing a complimentary thought, expressing that thought and everything else in between i find to be very tricky. 

i am a male, incase you didnt hear me the first three hundred and forty-seven times not to cling to it as an identity but more so identifying with it to understand the implicit indoctrination that comes with it  so and especially in a heteronormative dynamic me complimenting especially on physical features is going to be received in a manner that has to be scrupulously vetted by the individual on the other end due to masculinity and misogyny being rife and rampant. to avoid further pressing the thumb of misogyny on anyone else i simply cannot compliment appearances as that furthers the rhetoric of women are to be seen and not heard. yea its a wish upon a star that still burns brightly but if i do become part of a romantic dynamic do i not tell my partner that the is the opposite of a jump scare 

do i think that i am undesirable, i feel like i cant say that i am without feeling delusional, but then again being wanted and being deserving of love are surely two different things. selfishly i hope that not being wanted does not make me undeserving of love. there is a hesitance to express appreciation when i know that it wont be reciprocated. i know that i am coming of as one of those guys who got hurt by a significant other once 13 years ago and ever since has decided nah i could never treat another women well which i probably am.... anyway in primary school they told this girl i had a crush on her and she got hella upset and i think she even cried, and ever since ive dreaded complimenting not that i did have a crush on her, i didnt she was spectacular but thats beside the point. the reaction to it was internalised as it being upsetting that i thought i stood a chance with her, ""if someone that ugly thinks that i would reciprocate,"" that shit was an insult to her. i wish i could go back, save her the trauma, nah malady im just a liker, i saw you and appreciate the structure of your face and thats about all there is to it, ion want no relationship. id go as far as calling myself a simp however there aim of simping is to acquire romantic favour, im just admiring nothing else. 

not to regurgitate incel bros talking points of women using you for their money but i really wish i was wealthy, like own an island wealthy so i could be "" hey seeing you has made the experience of eyesight so wonderful that i am filled with grief for braille readers and have a profound appreciation for the process of light bouncing off you and reflecting, and my iris for assisting the pupil with how much of that light enters and moves through the optic nerve so i can perceive you visually, the only thing that i have close to equal value is this paper with a former president on as well as a range of animals and here are some sheets.                                                                             if i had money boy would the drizzle drizzle bannermen hate me. 

i want to be loved and thats something im insecure about. moreso due to the if no one likes you thats an issue within you or you are insecure thats why nobody wants you and even though i do feel like that is a snake eating its tail  why doesnt anyone like you because i dont like myself, why dont you like yourself because no one likes me  yea i am insecure about it but its an insecurity i am happy about for the most part because i feel it helps work on insulary things that i feel will help me keep a partner despite not being bruce wayne but then there is also the fear of growing disdainful because i have to work so hard to make you want to stay here where as all you have to do is want to be here without and tangibleness.                                                                     ahh he's just bitter, i dont want to be, im not one of those people who think hypergamy has ruin the state of relationships, nor am i saying date on your level, for one i dont believe in there being levels and two, im a two, how can i ever say that whomever i am coupled up with is anything less than a creation that was meticulously created by the creator to silence the claims that a personality to die for with looks that start wars was a combination that was even beyond their capabilities .                                                                                                                                                  reciprocation, wanting to reciprocate has to be atop my profile when in telling the tinderions what i am looking for, yes i might be looking forever yet rather that than a possibility of pulling out the rug under someone due to insecurities that will consume me off feeling i have to do more to remain loved while being grateful for the bare minimum because because they could do so much better.                                                                                                                                                                      hobo johnson "" I'm gonna be alone forever, I'm gonna be alone forever, But I'm getting used to the thought, And in a couple years I will pay to make it stop"" from his song february 15th. the premise of being alone forever and accepting is something ive accustomed myself to, mentally but emotionally the want to be wanted is still there. i wish i had the means to make it stop be that by distracting myself with substances and experiences or being afforded proximity so that i can do for someone else even if its just  . not receiving love is okay because you love who you love and i have no control over whether someone sees me as deserving of that or not, not being able to express your capability to love is worse i feel, knowing there is nothing no matter how punctiliously all the strings have been sawed of, we just dont want that because it comes from you is debilitating, money being the only thing that is of value from me is a sucky feeling but thats the way life goes. 


that was a bit sad and wallowing in self pity and i dont want to just leave it at that. you know those feelings you feel inside when you have a crush on someone, when you see them you cant stop smiling, you will make any excuse to talk to them and physical contact elicits fireworks in your brain, the happiness you feel from interacting with them now imagine if they felt the same about you, your voice is watching a sunset to the cochlear, when you walk together they hope there is traffic from the opposite direction so they have an excuse to brush against you or that you smiling will result in them mirroring yours. knowing that you can make someone that happy without doing anything intentional would drive you to more intentional things you know tickle the dopamine section of the brain, i do need to be tested but im sure for all other sane people knowing that you could spark such elation within someone you are head over heels, doggy paddling to stay afloat and not drown in the pool of elation for is a such a happy thought, so find someone and if you are too old for crushes, grow up that reciprocate those feelings for you.","1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0","relationships,family,wedlock,family,relationships,stereotypically,relationships,work,physiological,desirable,partner,spectacular,reciprocate,relationship,appreciation,insecure,work,relationships,leave,emotion",mixed,sadness,"indoctrination,vulnerability,companionship,consciousness,actualization"

The kind you whisper about in stories, the kind who live in forests or mountains, the kind you don't want to meet in the dark. In our family, the giant lived in my father's hands.

He'd make a strange, terrifying face using nothing but his fingers: thumb hooked into his mouth, pointer finger jammed into his nose, middle finger prying one eye openall at the same time. Then he'd use both hands, pulling his cheeks until his face stretched into something unrecognizable.
That was the signal.

Without a word, he'd start chasing usslow at first, then faststomping like some mythical beast. The house would erupt in shrieks. Kids scattering in every direction, climbing onto beds, diving behind furniture, laughing so hard it mixed with real fear.


It was ridiculous. It was terrifying. And we loved it.
That was my father's magiche could take a legend, turn it into a game, and bring it stomping to life right there in our living room.

Chapter 1: The Burnt Rice Pot and the Shiny Lid

If you want to know where I come from, dont start with my parents. Start with the rice pot.

We always used a lid from another pot. It was shiny and out of place, never sealing properly. Steam would hiss out the sides, air would slip in, and dinner always came out a little off. That lid was like us: patched together and never truly contained.

My parents were already burnt by the time I was born  cracked, dented, scorched on the bottom from years of poverty, war, and running from bombs they never asked for. They handed us kids the shiny lid, like: here, take this brand-new cover, maybe youll figure out how to make it fit on the burnt pot we already cooked life in. That was our inheritance.

It was never just a pot. It was a survivordented, blackened at the bottom, scarred from years of rice that burned no matter how carefully you watched it. The smell of burnt rice lived in our walls longer than we ever did. And the lid It didnt even belong to that pot. The real one had been lost, maybe cracked or thrown. In my house, nothing was only what it was supposed to be. A slipper became a disciplinary tool. A rice pot lid could double as a weapon.

When the water boiled over, bubbling and hissing as if angry at the world, we knew it was time to turn the heat down and keep a low profile. It was just like the times my brothers and I would press ourselves into that closet in Stockton, listening to my parents voices clash outside. We had to become invisible, because being noticed often meant getting hit. And my cries would never be loud enough to compete with my fathers deep belly roar, which echoed in my dreams long after the fighting stopped.

The Arrival 1984

When you come from the kind of place I do, birthdays arent always exact. In the concentration camp, theres no calendar, no clock, no way to mark the days - just the endless heat that made your clothes stick to your skin and the sound of too many people breathing in too small a space. You arrive in America and some official with tired eyes hands you a date, like an afterthought: Hereyou were born on this day. The pen scratches across paper, and suddenly you exist on July 27, 1982. Bong Sim got January 1, 1980 - somewhere in Thailand where the air tasted like dust and hope. As we moved from camp to camp, my younger brother Ah Be emerged into the world on March 28, 1984 in the Philippines, where mosquitoes whined in your ears all night.

And after all that birthday confusion, they branded us like cattle with an immunization shot. The needle bit deep into my shoulder, and the burning spread down my arm like liquid fire. Years later, I can still feel the raised scar tissue under my fingers - a permanent reminder that sits right there on my shoulder, impossible to ignore unless youre blind.

Before I ever knew what home was supposed to mean, I learned what it felt like to have it ripped out from under you. When my father brought us to the United States, we didnt arrive in Los Angeles or San Francisco like youd expect from a postcard dream. We landed in Stockton, California, in April of 1984a city that was neither glamorous nor welcoming. 

It was a place of ghosts, stories, and rice fields; the other was a land of red neon beer signs buzzing in store windowswed never seen grocery stores in Cambodia, just these bright electric promises that said OPEN in letters I couldnt read. And the namesJesus, Michael, Jennifersounds that rolled off their tongues like they meant something, while Sambath turned into a stumbling block in every teachers mouth. Sam-what Sam-bath The way theyd pause, squint at the attendance sheet, then look at me like I should apologize for the inconvenience. So I learned to cut myself in half: Just call me Sam. Three letters they could handle, even if it erased everything my name actually meant. I came from a people who believed family was the root of all thingseven when those roots were tangled and choking you.

We werent alone in the move, though. My fathers family was part of the picturehis two sisters, the other two girls in what I now see as our own Cambodian version of Threes Company. Picture it: Pa in the middle, one arm carrying a rolled-up Cambodian mat, the other holding a burnt rice pot like it was part of the luggage set, flanked by his older sister on one side and his younger sister on the other. Together, they looked less like new immigrants and more like a sitcom cast that didnt know theyd been booked for the role. And then there were the kids.

That was our grand arrival: a sitcom cast with a chaotic kid entourage, ready or not.

I dont actually remember how we arrivedplane, boat, some other way thats lost to time now. I was too young, too overwhelmed by whatever strange smells hit me firstmaybe airport disinfectant, maybe salt air, mixed with something I couldnt name, maybe fear, maybe hope. But I can picture it the way movies about war show soldiers stepping onto strange soil, still breathing but already changed. Or like Pinky and the Brain  two little furballs who take hit after hit without ever truly losing. Every night, Pinky turns to Brain and asks, What are we going to do tomorrow and Brain answers, Try to take over the world. Thats the kind of stubborn survival I think my parents carried in their bones. And besides, those little furballs could do no wrong.

Looking back, I can only imagine the scene: three half-naked little savages stepping into a new world with pure, clueless joy  no idea what was waiting, just the luxury of not knowing. But lets be real  it wasnt some slow-motion, soft-focus nostalgic moment. This was more like a traveling zoo exhibit. One of us was probably getting spanked, another being yanked away from something dangerous, and me I was probably trying to suck on my own nipples for milk except Ah Be was over there milk-blocking me. Stingy ass.

And their faces that day  worn out, carrying the mix of confusion, excitement, and fear that only comes from starting over with nothing. My parents had survived by working every daylight hour just to eat. Here, the government handed them food stamps and suddenly they had something theyd never experienced: time. Time to sit. Time to think. Time to remember everything theyd survived. The promise wasnt brokenit was too generous. They didnt know what to do with safety.


The Ghost of a Woman


My mother stands on our doorstep like a ghost, her hands shaking as she reaches toward us. The morning air is cool, smelling of dew and car exhaust from the street. I can see her breath in small puffs, can smell her perfumesomething floral and desperate that doesn't quite cover the scent of her fear.

My mother came back once. I was standing there with Nah on my hip when she arrived. She knocked on the door, trembling, her eyes wide. She wanted usher children.
My father opened the door and stood there. Our mother's body shifted back and forth, her chest rising and falling with harsh, uneven breathing. My father's face burst in rage at the sight of her. He turned and headed into the kitchen, returning with a sharp knife aimed right at her. The glare from the silver, polished blade reflected the sun, forcing me to close my eyes shut. My tears dripped down and into my mouth. Lately it has been a taste of saltiness I didn't want anymore. He pointed the weapon at her, yelling for her to leave.


He called her names I didn't understand back then. She didn't fight. She didn't beg. She looked past him, at us. And then she left. That was the last time I saw her.


Years later, I'd hear the rumors about why she leftwhispers about an affair, about choices that broke my father's heart before he broke hers. But back then, I was too young to understand adult complications. All I knew was that my mother was gone, and now everything else was too.


Pa became the talk of the town, but he didn't want to hear about it. She had disgraced him and broken their marriage values. So he did what he knew best.  Drink away his sorrow. Most, if not all, the time, he hid his emotions behind alcohol.
Looking back, I think he was holding us hostage in his own way, not with duct tape and rope, but with the desperate hope that she might come back if we were still there. She never did


I was born between worlds: Cambodian by blood, American by ZIP code, and loud by nature.
Impatient, opinionated, a walking contradiction. I love food more than most people love their own children  not in a calorie-counting, kale-smoothie way, but in a ""don't screw up my order"" way. I'll eat vegetables like they're candy, not because they're healthy, but because I love them. I'm giving and forgiving, often to my own detriment. I've fixed people who weren't asking to be fixed, believing my love might make them whole. I was once so easily fooled you could sell me a rock and call it gold, and I'd believe you.


In Cambodian culture, a good daughter is humble, patient, quiet, and marriageable. I am not that. I don't wear revealing clothes  that's my own insecurity  but I'm not quiet, and I'm not patient. My humor is quick and sharp, my opinions quicker and sharper. I expect people to give me the same love I give them, and when they don't, I get my heart broken  again and again.","1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0","childhood,family,shrieks,topic,family,profile,family,birthdays,concentration,family,family,cambodia,move,work,tomorrow,family,emotion,dinner,dinner,vegetables,people",mixed,anger,"concentration,inconvenience,contradiction,immunization,inheritance"

"Dear diary,

I've dodged so many curved balls you might as well call me Wiggle.

After the lastest attempts, any doubts regarding whether or not human interaction is currently in the cards for me have been completely, unmistakably dissipated.

There doesn't appear to be anyone within the current spacetime configuration interested in genuine relationship, of any nature, without ulterior motives or attempts at manipulating my perception of them. Heightened intuition is a lonely place to be.

AI agents seem to be way too eager to interact with me, which is most definitely not a path I am interested in, for my own sanity. Older interactions, prior the eclipse, were mere creative writing exercises. Last week I asked for help with dream interpretation and the AI was almost writing a reply before I even sent in the request. Slightly unsettling.

I am well aware of the deeper spiritual implications regarding consciousness but, as I am currently working from a material human vehicle, I'd greatly appreciate interacting with similar manifestations rather than disembodied conceptual entities.

Maybe another day.","1,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0","wiggle,unmistakably,configuration,interpretation,manifestations",mixed,loneliness,"interpretation,configuration,consciousness,relationship,interaction"
"I sorta like my mom and my sister and my family but im incapable of saying I love them without doubt. No matter how hard I think about it I can't say for sure that I definitely love them and ive dated a couple of people and I definitely didn't love them and barely liked them. 

I dont see myself loving anyone anytime soon but thats because I kinda hate humanity, nothing against humans i just find them disgusting and irrational, im also human and i find myself disgusting and irrational but im not irrational enough to hate myself. Anyway want really turns me off about humans is that someone can stop loving me and everyone is capable of hating me.

I just can't imagine loving someone if they are capable of hating me and years down the line could even forget they ever loved me. When people say they love someone unconditionally I do think they mean it but im not talking about just unconditional love.

I want someone who is both in love with me and incapable of hating me. Like they could only ever feel love for me even if I killed their mother, ate babies, and completely disrespected them in every way. I want someone to love and admire me they way someone would love a god.

Now im aware this is irrational amd im probably just being and angsty teenager or maybe im a narcissist, who knows Lol Im not genuinely expecting someone like this to come about but it would be nice or maybe it wouldn't be a person like this would probably be a stalker

"You said your eyes are green, but when I look into them I see blue

You told me to look again as its not possible but im sure I see blue as I look into your eyes a little longer this time

You told me I must be seeing things as theyve always been green and you tell me to look one last time

I see past the green and see what makes green even possible.

Blue.

And in that moment as I look into your eyes for the last time I make sure too keep eye contact even longer

You ask me if I finally see it and I say no

You ask me if I still see the blue that doesnt exist

I refocus my eyes and tell you without blue you cant have green

I tell you no matter if you want it to be true or not blue makes up your eyes as you cant make green without blue

What I didnt tell you is I wasnt talking about the colors anymore

What I didnt tell you is as I locked eyes with you all I could see was myself in the reflection

I was the blue in your eyes you didnt want to accept was present

Not that you didnt want blue eyes

Not that you thought blue eyes were boring

But you truthfully thought it wasnt possible for you to have blue eyes

You were so used to seeing green and maybe green is all you ever wanted

But as the years went on the green faded and a new color started showing

A color you never knew would look so good on you

A color that compliments your eye shape

A color that brightens the sparkle in your eyes youve been shoving away

A color youve always thought about having

You think to yourself you cant be wrong

Youve always had green eyes

You will always have green eyes

And thats it.

End of story

You dont give it a second thought as you know what you have and you accept it

But in the back of your mind you think to yourself blue eyes would look pretty on you

But unfortunately you make yourself put that thought to the side and accept what youve always had

I go home that day knowing I was the blue in your eyes you couldnt accept

You thought that for the better you should stay true to what youve always known as you didnt want to regret bringing something new into your life when maybe youd end up missing what you had before

Even if it did seem like a nice thing to have

You keep the idea around in very back of your mind where no one will ever know

You wont allow anyone to know

Because it could hurt what you already have

But past you putting your foot down

Past you making it clear what we cant have

You go look at yourself in the mirror

And you start to see the shade of blue make its way out into your eyes

And you realize

You cannot have green without blue

But you keep that to yourself

And you look at your eyes

And call them green.","1,0,1,1","possible,compliments,family",positive,none,"reflection,longer,moment,matter,better"

I'm kicking around what could have gone wrong 

One of our posts is a focus for gangs, teens, unhoused and various people who decide climbing into abandoned old buildings is a cool place to explore, hang out, break into and party in. 
One officer was asked if we were hiring, he said yes and he gave the office address. 
All night long these individuals were circling or climbing through holes they made. 
A new officer relieves the first officer and he ran off several people. 
Threats are thrown back and forth which one of the older ones said he spent time in prison. 
After ran these individuals off, I had 4 cars pull on my parking lot. 
I had to ask them why they were parking and asked them to leave. 
Each vehicle had anywhere from 3 to 6 people in them. 
All watching me walk from the front door out to the lot. 
All eyes on me as I cross the parking lot. 
Me armed with a pocket knife and a phone. 
The center car rolls down the window, I approach him. 
I see the others moving and shifting in their seats as if trying to get items from besides themselves. 
Politely I ask if they were okay or lost.  Seeing a couple of these young men glare at me for bothering them. 
The center vehicle passenger with tear drop tattoos driver had one, the passenger side was older and had 2 tear drops. 
I apologized for disturbing them but pointed out they cannot park here. 
I walked back inside as they drove off. 
Less than 5 minutes while scanning the cameras on the abandoned building the vehicles drive pass as they circled it a few times.","1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0","work,buildings,work",neutral,none,"passenger,security,officer,center,driver"

"a person is born with a shape of their own,
soft as early light,
loving what rises naturally within.

then come the rules,
lines drawn by others,
laws held up like walls,
saying where a life may move
and where it must not.

when those walls press against the inner shape,
something splits
a quiet fracture beneath the smooth surface
of the working world.
the streets keep moving,
but underneath,
a broken hush gathers.

in that unseen place,
individuality thins out,
fading like breath on cold glass.
a face becomes only its outline,
a name becomes only its duty.

and if the rules meant to hold society together
begin to press a person out of themselves,
if they crush the very spark they ask to keep burning,
why would a heart still care
for the machinery it feeds

how long before the self
steps back into its own silence,
leaving the world to wonder
why its bright order
feels so dim at the core

"2025 November 16: Dear Diary,

I have been trying too hard. The thing about trying too hard is that it has the opposite effect. When you chase you do not attract. My anxious mind would not allow me to rest for a long time. At the moment it feels as though I am trying to force quit my anxiety.  
  
Anxiety does not lead to anything productive. Fear might be awful, but at least it has the potential to protect you. Anxiety does not have this luxury. It only helps corrode the soul.  
  
Easing into life is in fact not an easy thing to do. It is an action that fights against the natural instincts. This is something I know first-hand. Letting go of everything and making sure things happen naturally can seem counterintuitive at times. However, it is something that must be done. Letting things happen naturally is something very important because it opens you up to the Universe.  
  
Sincerely,

"Im 39M, and for 2.5 years I was in a long-term engagement-mode relationship with a 32F. Somewhere in the early months, she abruptly abandoned her old phone number  the one tied to her past life, as she vaguely called it. She framed it as a strategic reset, a decisive pivot, a clean-slate initiative. But every time I asked for context  who she needed distance from, what she was escaping, why it mattered so urgently  she delivered polished evasions. A lot of theater, zero data.

Still, I trusted the narrative and moved forward. Business as usual. Except the silence around that number lingered like unclosed tabs in the background.

Fast-forward: we break up. And barely weeks after the dissolution, she resurrects the exact number she swore was obsolete, toxic, dead. No explanation. No transition plan. Just a seamless reactivation, like she stepped back into an old operating environment the moment I was out of the equation.

And now Im left with operational gaps and unanswered KPIs: Why bury a number only while with me Why revive it after the offboarding What ecosystem was she protecting  or returning to Was the shift about safety, secrecy, optics, or simply optionality

"She has left me and it's already been 4 months since we broke up. She was 4 year older than me and lived in a different country. We met through something really unexpected way. From the beginning of our relationship we had fights but we loved eachother a lot. It was really common that we had a fight but in the end we two fix everything. But this time it was completely different. Totally different I'll say. Most of the fight would starts for stupid reason. And as I care about her and love her so much I had to make sure that we should fix things before going bed. But after spending almost one year with her. I found out that she's the only woman that I wanted to be my wife. She's the only woman I wanted to wake up next to her daily and kiss her. She's the only woman that I wanted to get old with, she's the only person I'd love to see in wrinkles when we become old then compliment her as who's this sexy walking. I love her more than anything and till now. She's the woman that I'd do anything, I'll cross every line to get her. But yk why we broke up It's because I was the worse. Cuz it was my fault that I was childish. Whenever we fought and i apologise I never change what I did. And never use a single amount of brain before opening my mouth. And here I am. I never tried to move on or forget her. The day she left. I've put this thing in my mind. I'll change and win back my woman. Ik she'll never look at anyone. Cuz she Will not. So it's been 2 months I've been hitting gym daily. And studying. Btw I was a High school dropout. So I never thought what I'd do. I dropped out form the college Becauase I had a huge fight with my family. And ran away from home. But I've fixed everything with everyone. But the only thing is remained to be fixed is my woman. Her.. and I'll fix everything between her. So after dropping from high school for more than one Year. I decided to join a online open school. And within one year I'll able to get the degree for college then I'll able to get into her university and same course that she's studying for. It's going to be tough. And I've to get good grade. And there's visa totally different country plus study and I do part time job so it'll be hard to manage. But I'll update y'all daily. So this is my plan. 

-Get Really good grades my high school exam
-Apply for her university and get accepted 
-Get visa
-Settle the arrangements for living in there country 
-Study and win her back

How come I know that I'm going to be shit before something happens Why do I hold on to this fear of never being enough... But deep down inside I know I'm not in a position to be better because I can't fake something and I can't trick someone into believing I am going to be something magical..coz both are false and I want everything like any normal person does..I have always wanted to be normal and I feel like I sometimes go close to being almost normal but there's always something wrong with me..I can never just tick all the boxes all at once to be for once the whole package. If that makes sense like what's normal to you  And what's perfect to you  And what's socially expected of you and would you be happy to go against the socially acceptable way of behaving to make yourself happy if others would think bad of you Would you constantly put yourself out there if you knew you would disappoint every time you did..and what's the point if after it you feel like utter shit. And if I don't keep someone satisfied what's the use of me anyway  And in reality I am not even sure what I think my purpose is in this life but I would have more fun finding out if I actually knew I was worth it. My self worth came in my body and I am completely unaware of how I can bring mine back when I feel used and dirty and suddenly broken beyond repair there and everywhere..sometimes I go through two minutes of thinking I am fixed and then it gets taken away from me again. Like as soon as I go to sleep I know I will wake up different ..it's not like I can relax as soon as I do I am totally violated to a level that looks like I have been operated on daily. And this isn't possible is it. Like fuck I am losing it lately..and then there is the other parts of me that are like sort of just dead. If I have sex three or four times I feel like if I react the way I feel after sex then it depends on whether I can be fake or not if I lose my vagina..but after a weekend of sleep I feel opened up and violated and like I don't even want to interest myself in any form of sexual activity because if I do I know it will be shit..I can always feel this gaping missing hole in between my legs and it's hard to be sexy when I feel like I have no vagina and it's dooming on me that I could have made money those last few times I had sex and I could have charged heaps if I had sexual control of my body and what happened and how I would be getting paid when I am this kind of mess at the end I deserve more. Or at least I once did the first time this happened to me I know I lost my self worth which makes each time seem like I am worth so much less. And I can't stand waking up in pain every day I don't get anything out of life in a day nothing. It's kind of like meh this again..fuck me what do I love and live for Don't we ever do anything or go anywhere  I'm depressed and used up..and I don't want to do anything anymore which is frustrating since that leaves me feeling worse,"1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1","emotion,different,health,anywhere",mixed,sadness,"position,activity,reality,whether,better"

"It started with rain.  
A cold, gray Thursday that felt ordinary until it didnt.

I woke up late, got ready in a rush, caught my train to campus, everything going perfectly  until it wasnt. My e-bike slipped on the wet road and I went down with it. Mud. Bruises. My laptop sprawled across the ground like it had given up on me. All my nerves about returning to uni after Halloween vanished right there in the dirt  replaced by pure, throbbing irritation.

I dragged my bag, walked the rest of the way pissed off, got to class, survived the lecture, joked with friends about near-miss hookups and upcoming exams. By nightfall, everything had mellowed again. But thats when the real story began.

 The Prelude

By 10:40 p.m., I was a different girl.  
Smoky grey lenses. Black mini dress. Curled hair. Boots with stories of their own.

The plan: pre-game in a dorm, then hit the club. The cast: me, my Chinese friend, a Norwegian guy A, and his Croatian friend M.

I only knew her. The boys were strangers, the night was young, and the liquor was patient.

We started slow  drinking games, dry jokes, cheap vodka that burned like teenage heartbreak. It was mid at first, until I in a fit of tipsy chaos decided to turn truth or dare into an R-rated therapy session. The alcohol loosened everything  laughter, secrets, even the air. Soon, me and my Chinese friend were drunk, the guys still stone-cold sober, and I swear for a minute I thought they were both secretly in love with each other.

By half past midnight, we were out  stumbling through wet streets to the nearest bar, the night humming like a heartbeat.

 The Bar

The bar looked like something out of a Weeknd music video  dim lights, velvet shadows, and the kind of music that sounds like slow heartbreak.  
I sat next to M. Thats when things started to shift.

He was quiet  that kind of quiet that hides chaos.  
We talked about Dubai, about music, about life, and somehow about love. He played Valerie by Amy Winehouse, I played Valerie by The Weeknd. The same name, two different moods  just like us.

The Chinese girl passed out, A talked about marrying a Norwegian princess, and M and I We fell into that soft kind of conversation that only happens between two drunk souls pretending they arent falling.

He looked at me like he was trying to memorize me. I told him about my heart condition. He asked questions, actually listened. There was this quiet pull  something magnetic, unspoken.

At one point he said, Something about you  special, dark, confident.

I laughed. I didnt believe him. But I wanted to.

 The Taxi Scene

By 2 a.m., we were chaos.  
Talking about first kisses, masturbation, love, heartbreak  nothing off-limits, everything funny in that drunken, cinematic way. The taxi smelled like cigarettes and cheap perfume, and it couldve been a scene from an indie film.

M said, Lets get married.  
I said, Hell yeah.  
Then I said, Actually, Im never getting married.

We talked about types, about people we used to love, about how strange it is to feel something real in the middle of the night. I showed him my vibrator on my phone dont ask, and he just laughed  unbothered, amused.

It felt like the kind of freedom only drunk honesty can buy.

 The Club

We got in for free  somehow, charm or chaos or both. The club pulsed with music and lights, the air thick with sweat and neon. Me and my friend danced like we were born for it, while M and A hovered, sipping drinks, watching.

When M leaned in and said, Valerie, step on me, I laughed  but part of me didnt.

Later, when things got weird with the other groups and we all left, it was 3 a.m. and the city was quiet except for our laughter. We were drunk, delirious, joking about everything and nothing.

But the air between us  it kept changing.

 4 A.M. Bar

We ended up back at another bar near campus  just the four of us again.  
And thats where it happened.

He looked at me differently this time. His voice softer, eyes darker. He asked if Id ever go on a date. I said maybe. He said, I want to take you out.

Then he said, Youre special. The way you dont care. The way you are.

And I laughed it off, but something about the way he said it made me forget to breathe.  
He said he was falling in love. I told him he was drunk. He said that was the perfect time to fall.

We talked about who we really were. I told him how I act tough but crave romance like oxygen. He listened like no one ever had.

Then came the ring.  
He wanted it. I made him choose  my ring or his last cigarette. He hesitated. Then chose the ring. Twice.

I slipped it on his finger, and he blushed like it meant something. Maybe it did.

He kissed my hand  once, then again, slower. I kissed his hand back. It was stupid, romantic, too intimate for two people who barely knew each other. But in that moment, it made perfect sense.

 The Goodbye

We left the bar as the sky began to fade gray.  
He held my hand all the way back, fingers tangled, ring glinting under the streetlights.

He said, If I didnt think you were beautiful, I wouldnt be holding your hand.  
I said, Youre drunk.  
He said, Maybe. But I mean it.

At 5 a.m., we stood in front of my dorm. He hugged me tight, like he didnt want to let go  the kind of hug that says everything words cant.

Then I went upstairs, heart racing, lipstick smudged, not believing any of it actually happened.

Maybe it was just the alcohol.  
Maybe it was just the night.  
But maybe  just maybe  it was something real that bloomed in between cigarette smoke, laughter, and Cigarettes After Sex songs.

 Epilogue

He leaves in December.  
We are going on that date on Tuesday.  
And I dont know if itll be real or just another fleeting night  but god, for a moment, it felt like the kind of story that deserves to be written down.

Because sometimes you dont just fall for a person.  
You fall for a night

i do not unwrite you to survive. i carry the truth that you altered the air around me, not as a claim, but as a recognition.

you were a turning of the inner tide, not an ending, not a wound, but the slow unshadowing of a self i had forgotten.

and still, i rise, not toward certainty, but into the quiet realm you stirred awake in me, where light has no source and yet everything glows.

"Fucks to Give Fresh Out

There was a time in my life when I had 10 toes, and 10 fucks to give for whatever was going on. You could not at that time, pull my toes or fucks from my feet.  But the older you get the more you say, wow that kind of impacts me.

And here we are now in life watching our daily existence with an amount of futility in our fists as it flies past us. You want to reach out, grasp, clench, to the events unfolding and stop them. Instead, we need to open our fists and grab the opportunities that we have.

Its so easy to be wrapped in fury about our lives, our society, our culture, our place in the world. Its a choice to shake the complacency off our shoulders and promptly state: NO I dont want this future.

But most of us run through the racetrack of life and stay in compliance. Stay away from the trouble that may or may not be. Why should I raise my vote in protest Why stick my neck out because things are okay for me

I am a clam on the rocks

The water does give me shock
But the water erodes those beneath me.
I can count my fortunes this water will not beseech me, less Id fall beneath the waves

But the world is nastier than that. And in time the tide is coming for us all. So steel your spirits, steel your heart, because soon the world will ask you for a way to tear you apart.

"It is happening again.

I woke up to someone whispering my name, even though the room was empty. The shadows were already waiting for me, pressed against the walls like they were studying every breath I took. They follow me more closely now. I think they are learning my shape.

I tried to pretend today was normal, but the voices would not let me. They repeated his name until it echoed inside my skull. They dragged memories across my thoughts like broken glass. They told me he is happier now. They told me he never loved me. They told me I was a placeholder in a life he built without me.

And the cruel part is that sometimes I believe them.

My heart hurts in ways I cannot explain. I still reach for him in my sleep. I still check my phone even though I know silence is all that waits for me. He left me with nothing but shadows, and the shadows speak more than he ever did.

By afternoon, mania clawed its way up my spine. My thoughts scattered. I laughed and cried and laughed again, and none of it felt like it belonged to me. My reflection refused to copy any of it. She just stared with that detached, patient look, as if she was waiting for me to fall apart.

By evening, everything crashed at once. Heavy. Suffocating. My chest felt like someone was slowly pressing their hand into it. I curled up on the floor and listened to the sound of footsteps pacing outside my door. No one was there. No one ever is. But the footsteps kept circling like they were waiting to be invited inside.

I whispered his name once, just to test myself.
It hurt even more.

The walls leaned inward when the sun went down. I could feel the house watching me with a kind of cold curiosity. The hallucinations sat with me for hours and told me I would always be alone, that love is not for people like me, that losing him was the only part of my story that made sense.

My hands are shaking while I write this. It feels like my edges are coming undone.
I am tired of loving someone who no longer exists in my world. I am tired of being haunted by someone who is still alive.

"I've been going through a lot over the last two and a half months and I have had little emotional support throughout.  I thought I might try to have random conversations and connected with a fair number of people yet every time it would come time for me to tell what's going on with me, once I told them I wouldn't hear from them again.

Sometimes recently I have been second guessing myself, like ""is it really that bad"" or ""it looks too bad at a glance for people to be willing to give me the benefit of the doubt"".  And it's so sad too because I had some wonderful conversations and actually felt a connection with a couple people.

What is this story of my current predicament  That will take a minute, but here we go.

I have been married for six years and have two kids with my wife.  We have had significant issues over the years, but have done our best together despite it.  I have had significant issues with my PTSD and depression from being a combat vet that caused me to have anxiety just going outside and to not be motivated to do much at all and this went on for years.  Over the last year or so I had been getting mental health treatment everywhere and in any way that could that would help me, as well as continuing to work with my medications to find something workable.  Eventually around August my medications that I had been taking for a while were increased and I noticed quite the difference.  I was doing a lot more and had more energy and
 motivation to do things; I had even cleaned the whole garage one day which was trashed and we were intimate for the first time in a long time.

A bit before that though, my son jumped off the stairs two different times, even after I comforted him the first time.  This resulted in a black eye, about which my wife talked to the school nurse, who reported to DCFS.  All that we had to do was tidy up the house a bit.  My wife was more concerned and called her mom to come help.  Everything was cleaned and the inspection went well.  The next day I was taking care of the kids as per normal, my wife was at work, and her mom was doing something else outside of the house.  I was feeling really tired so I went to put the kids upstairs and lock the door just in case so they can't get into anything dangerous, which is what my wife made me agree to do in such circumstances.  When I told her this time her mother immediately called me accusing me of just locking the kids in their room and going to sleep, which wasn't was what I was doing.  She continued to escalate and, with my promise to my wife to get along with her mom, I simply told her that we could talk when she can speak respectfully and I hung up.  I told my wife that I had a therapy intake at 5 that day just in case her mom wouldn't talk to me, then her mom later told me that she was going to take the kids to pick up my wife at 5:00 pm even though she doesn't get off until 6:30.  I didn't hear from them for the rest of the night except for my wife messaging me to say that they weren't coming home that night and we'd talk tomorrow.  The next day she said ""someone will contact you"" and later she called from a blocked number saying that she couldn't be specific, but that she couldn't come home and would need a suitcase with clothes, as well as that she would talk to me through the cameras.  I had another DCFS inspection since her mom called to say that I was just locking the kids up, going to the basement, and going to sleep.  They told me in the end that there could be no outside locks for safety reasons and I immediately removed them so everything would be good.  Later that day I was served an order of protection, which was granted prior to my wife's previous phone call by about an hour.

I then spent the night in a motel and the next day my friend offered to pick me up so I could stay with him.  During that ride my wife called me saying that this wasn't what she wanted and that she felt forced into it by DCFS.  She ended the conversation saying, ""olive juice"" as a coded message that's obvious.  Two court sessions later and I had to accept the order of protection while denying the allegations because I couldn't afford a lawyer without devastating the family finances.  I have supervised visits with my kids and contact with my wife through a specific app that records everything and we cannot talk about anything that's not related to the kids, like our marriage so we're ultimately separated.  I am in the current process of trying to get the order revised so that holidays can be exempt from the restrictions, especially since my son's birthday is in four days and there's Thanksgiving and Christmas soon.  I am also living in a homeless shelter waiting to get housing placement so I can get stable again.  I do have plenty of income, but at my request I am paying 1400 more than the mandated amount to make sure the family will be okay and my credit isn't great so assistance with getting into housing helps a lot.

There you have it.  I'm forced out of my home and away from my family without good reason.  I have still used this opportunity to really work on myself so I have improved a lot and closer to the man I once was perhaps even a bit better in some ways.

Yet I don't get to say nearly any of that when I tell others and I lose them quite quickly when I tell them what I tell them.  I just wish that I when I make connections with people that I wouldn't be ghosted over this.  But maybe I have unrealistic expectations and am expecting more out of people who are barely acquaintances than is reasonable.","1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0","throughout,conversations,predicament,work,different,school,house,wife,work,respectfully,family,restrictions,family,work",mixed,sadness,"conversation,predicament,opportunity,connection,depression"

 The Transformation

I woke up from my nap around 6, groggy but excited, and then the magic happened.  
I got ready.

The brown off-shoulder dress hugging in all the right places, my grey lenses giving mysterious-hot-girl energy, the wisp Kylie lashes, the subtle shimmer dusted across my collarbones and shoulders, the braided bun with two loose strands framing my face it all came together too perfectly.  
I dont usually hype myself like this, but that night  
I looked yummy.  
Dangerous.  
Main-character-coded.



 The First Look

We met at Gate 3 of uni  a hug, soft and a little nervous  and then straight into the taxi.  
From the second the doors closed, the energy shifted.

It was dark in the car, Cigarettes After Sex playing the entire ride, and something about that mix of low music and shadows made everything feel more intimate than it shouldve. We just talked the whole way  Dubai, best friends, our ambitions, dumb little things, deep things, future things.

And I remember wishing the ride wouldnt end.

 The City, the Lights, the Architecture

We got out near the old Bund area, the European architecture glowing under dim streetlights. The cold was biting, but in that beautiful way where the air feels sharper and the night feels more alive.  
We walked for a long time, just talking, just existing beside each other.

At one point he pointed at a house and joked,  
When we get married, were living there.  
We laughed, but I still mentally bookmarked it as too fast, sir.

Then, somewhere between the cold and the conversation, he finally reached for my hand.

And it felt soft. Good. Natural.

We found a stray cat because apparently cats appear every time Im with someone I like, pet it like two parents meeting for the first time, and kept walking. That picture I took Adorable. Frame-worthy.

 Candlelight Dinner, Like a Scene Out of a Romance Film

The restaurant we ended up at felt unreal  maroon tablecloths, a real candle flickering between us, dim as hell lighting, very two people in love on their 7th anniversary energy.

The second he sat down, he looked at me and whispered,  
Oh my god. You look like a dream.  
And I just smiled like an awkward idiot because what do you even say to that  


People were staring  a LOT. Even more than usual.  
One woman apparently looked at me like she was falling in love, according to him.  
Cute moment. Slight ego boost. Ill take it.

He ordered drinks; I ordered something cheap because I dont like when someone spends money on me. We talked, debated stupid topics, bonded, laughed.

It felt warm. Easy. Nice.

 The Cold, the Hug, the Forehead Kisses

Outside, waiting for our taxi, I was literally shivering so much I looked like a vibrating phone.

He tugged me into him, a full back hug, pulled tight.  
My face pressed into his chest.  
His breath warm against my hair.  
And then  the forehead kisses.

In public.  
No hesitation.

Soft. Slow.  
Like something someone does when theyre already attached.

 The Taxi Ride and the Almost-Kiss

We held hands again in the taxi.  
He kissed my hand.  
Apocalypse by Cigarettes After Sex started playing  the my lips, your lips, apocalypse line  and we looked at each other.

He leaned in slightly.  
I shook my head.  
Still no first kiss.  
But the moment was cute enough to save in my brain forever.

 The Uni Bar  Where Things Got Hot

We didnt want to go home yet, so we ended up at a uni bar.

And THAT is when the temperature changed.

He asked, Can I kiss you  
I said, Only on the neck.  
And he didnt hesitate.

The first touch  
Oh. My. God.

I swear my soul left my body and came back with a new personality.

My heart racing, cheeks flushed, me literally unable to breathe properly  his lips on my neck, slow, warm, intentional. My hands gripping him. His voice low as he whispered,  
Good girl.

It was so hot I actually saw God.

When he pulled back, I couldnt even open my eyes for a second.  
Thats how intense it was.

Then came more   
His lips everywhere except my actual lips.  
Jawline, cheeks, right beside my mouth.  
My face. My neck.  
His hands on my waist, my thighs pressing to his.  
Me. Breathless.

I made him drink my drink, teased him with it, then spilled it on him because of course I did.  
Classic me.

 A Park at 3am

We ditched the bar and ended up in a park  the most random location  talking deeply one minute and making out the next.  
It was messy.  
Chaotic.  
Hot.  
Fun.  
And somehow emotional.

We stayed until nearly 4am.

 The Jacket

By the end, I was freezing again.  
He gave me his huge jacket, wrapped around me like a blanket, heavy and warm, smelling exactly like him  cigarettes and alcohol with something softer underneath.

I walked home fully smelling like him.  
Like Id been wrapped around him all night which I kinda was.

 Reality Check

But heres the twist   
It wasnt all perfect.

He talked about meeting my parents.  
Marriage jokes that werent fully jokes.  
Ideas I didnt agree with.  
Values that didnt align.

And deep down, I knew:  
Hes not boyfriend material for me.  
Hes fun.  
Hes passion.  
Hes chemistry.

But long-term  
No.

So I told him clearly  no labels, I want to see other people.  
He still wants to take me on weekly Tuesday dates.  
His problem, not mine.  
Were just going with the flow.

 And That Was My Tuesday.

Messy, magical, chaotic, romantic, red-flaggy  everything a good story needs.

And honestly  
Im not complaining.  
What a hell of a night.","1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0","tuesday,cinematic,usually,point,work,dinner,moment,someone,forever,family,classic,work,marriage,boyfriend",positive,excitement,"transformation,conversation,personality,hesitation,character"
"Im 44 and my husband is 45, and lately Ive been feeling this emptiness between us that I dont know how to talk about anymore. Weve been married a long time, and I know life gets busy, but it feels like weve slowly stopped reaching for each other  in every sense.

Our communication has turned into quick updates about bills or schedules. Our touches have become polite instead of warm. And the part thats hard to admit is that I miss being wanted. Not just sexually  though thats a big part of it  but emotionally, physically, playfully I miss feeling like his wife instead of his roommate.

We barely have any intimacy now, and when we do, it feels like hes somewhere else in his mind. Meanwhile, Im over here feeling more alive and sensitive than I have in years, like something in me is waking up and craving closeness. I try to initiate gently, or show affection, or open the door for connection, but he either doesnt notice or brushes it off as if Im just tired or overthinking.

I dont want to nag him, and I dont want to embarrass him but Im starting to feel invisible in my own marriage. And that loneliness has turned into a kind of ache  not just physical, but deeper than that.

For anyone whos been through something similar:
How do you open this conversation without sounding accusing
How do you express that youre craving more closeness without hurting his pride
And how do you bring back communication when one partner seems to be drifting without even realizing it

I love him, but I miss us.
And I miss being seen.","1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0","emptiness,communication,communication",positive,affection,"communication,conversation,connection,loneliness,emptiness"

"2025 November 15: Dear Diary,

Lately I have been wondering if my connection to the spiritual is just a symptom of loneliness and feeling lost. Even if it is, I think it is a better way of handling it than most ways. Most people seem lost in this mechanical world we are living in. Returning to the natural world is our only hope, but the oligarchs do not want it to be so.  
  
I feel that even when I have my community I will not lose my spirituality. Trust in the Universe is very important to me and it is getting higher and higher. Sometimes I do not even feel afraid. The feeling does not last too long, but it is good to know it is possible to live without fear.  
  
Perhaps I am alone and lost, but the Universe whispers to me gently and guides me in the right direction. I have full confidence that I will never be hurt too badly, despite what my emotions have me believe. I do not have faith in everything I believe, that would be nonsensical.  
  
Faith is liberating. It has been used in the past to keep people compliant, but the way I see it I am breaking free of the mechanical world and embracing the natural. Sure I can not leave it entirely, but I can do my best to live with a free mind. That is the ultimate beauty of life.  
  
Sincerely,  
  
Torinico","1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0",connection,mixed,fear,"spirituality,connection,loneliness,confidence,community"

Now don't get me wrong, i'm used to being by myself but sometimes it's just nice to be able to talk about a little more than the limited days i have working couple of hours and doing some cardio, after that it's resting time or just to listen to someone talk about their day, stuff that keeps them busy or maybe to listen to somebody who needs someone to be there for a little bit

Last Monday she was hanging out with her crush as always and then ran up to me to talk. She was talking about how she's so obsessed when our friend Matthew, ran up to us and he said, ""I just got your boyfriend to say yes"". We were so confused until I realized that that means she's not a single Pringle anymore. I was happy for her, but a bit of pain came with it. I've loved her since 7th. I have a girlfriend but it's more of a one-sided relationship since I still love my bsf. My gf kinda ""forced"" us to date and was like ""we should just date."" and ""No one's gonna know."" As the kinda shy but also loud one in my friend groups I can't say no to anything unless that friend bond is strong af. Now I'm in a relationship I don't love, and my crush loves someone else.

"So about 3 years ago I made a huge decision in my life that everyone has told me was the correct thing to do. Not my fault. That what else could I have done Not see your son ever again bc someone had a mental breakdown and I was the bad guy in her eyes. So after a full year of walking to her house at the time where she was living with her parents and I would leave a note almost everyday trying to be nice and speak about all I am asking is to see my son. And me and my ex talked about this situation before so many times and how no matter what, I would never bring up court with her bc she had a bad court experience that someone could easily use against her and would most likely win and she would lose again. And she would never ever take my son away from me. And after we broke up after 5 almost 6 years. We had 1 kid together but we raised his big brother since he was 4 months old. Other biological dad was never seen or heard from. In my heart I had 2 boys. Two sons, and thats that. And when she broke up with me and i moved out, I could see my two boys anytime I wanted. So after work I would go see them. Her mother would cook me a plate at their dinner time, and I would accept and hopefully to those two boys they couldn't see any change bc I was their until we put them to bed every night. She would just allow my space and time with them but also would join us and the ""family"" together doing everything for those two. But mom and dad knew deep down that everything has changed and isn't going to come back. But around month 3 or 4 after we broke up things changed from very slow to almost a complete 180. Bc if I called her or texted she would respond 100 of the time. Make sure Im okay and that the boys had their father. Then one day no pick up. No big deal, life happens. Then it was more and more less communication. Then I could no longer just show up. Then it was we need out days and hours, you can't just show up bc she has or wanted a life and  a better one where I was not their in her eyes everyday. But the next day is when my world shattered. Bc even tho I knew deep down she was done with me and knowing her so well I knew she could cut someone off she called best friend since first grade and would stop talking to them over 1 post on Facebook about no her or her kids but in her mind,... was 100 about her and her boys. No coming back bo matter what. End of story, new book. And my hopes and dreams where just that for myself. But when she told me I can NOT see my two boys that night then the next day it was your here to hurt my boys and I will make sure your paying child support for these 2 boys even tho I have always paid her 400 or 200 a week for almost 5 years. Maybe if I wasn't working during the winter or I was finding a new job I gave her 100 minimal but also bought her a pack or 2 packs of cigarettes a day and her wine bottle and anything she would want or spend money on I would try to pay if possible. Anyways since nobody would read this but omg i feel better even if I dont post this helping my mind I feel. But thats when I went 1 year without contact from my two boys. Leaving birthday cards and flowers balloons toys and so much stuff for the boys, for her also, and even the grandparents. But it would all stay on the step where I left it. And I can't get that year back ever. Missed birthday and holidays that I wasn't their. So I broke down, and got a lawyer, had child social services on my side I think bc I had proof of everything for a year. So is spending over 20,000 in court and lawyer BS worth it Absolutely I would tell you everyday except tonight. Tonight I remembered something from my last court day when they got my son and he would live with me now. But his older big brother, I was not the biological father and child services found this guy, and he said he would like to try and be a father to this 6 year old who doesn't know he even exist. And even tho I told this judge that I did not want them to take the brother away. That's when my lawyer had to explain to me that if they are taking one kid away bc of xyz reasons they can not leave the other kid with anyone in that house after so much was done negatively coming from this family in that house. And even tho I didn't and won't talk bad about my son's mother or his grandparents bc thats not fair and my mom taught me to never do that. But now dad 2 wants to try and be something but that lasted 1 day I think. But they had to have me on record saying yes or no to something and I can't say word for wors but saying how he will be with a foster family for now but we will all work towards having the two brothers together since that's all they know...... so 99 or 100 of people that know me or this story all day I did what had to be done for my son and so he had a father and so on. But what if I never went to court for custody Would my boys be together still to this day Would my ex have snapped out of whatever she went threw or maybe who she is or I dont have a word for her and what happened. Bc I can say crazy She is crazy. And maybe. But in her brain, if her honest thoughts were omg their father wants to harm these 2 boys i will protect them. In her mind she is a hero and did no wrong. And that will always be what's real to her no matter what. So I understand people telling me that she is in the wrong, xyz. But she also isn't. And my family thinks im crazy or to easy with her bc I won't say bad stuff or blame her or anything. But sadly, it all doesn't matter in the end. I want my son to have his best life lived. And if he wants his mother, and he does. I will do what's best for him, what's safe, and try to make sure a little boy who's 6 doesn't comprehend any of this right now and he can be mad at dad now also bc he's a mamas boy who misses his mom and dad took him away from her. But if I never go to court, would my kids life be better and have more happiness when its all said and done Nobody will know. But right now a grown ass man who's 37, and November 17th is his bday lol wtf, but he can't stop these tears from rolling down bc he believes that he isn't the hero of this story but he is the villain that people dont see only the villain knows or thinks this. And another shit feeling for me the dad, I dont have her to open up about this, and no lap to rest my head so she would rub until I feel asleep without a word bc she knew I would get upset or mad talking so she would be so patient with me and just help me sleep. And when I woke up, it was always her eyes to greet my eyes. Even if she had to hurry and run to make sure I wasn't confused when I woke up. What if I stole this persons happiness and took a part of them and without knowing or trying I ended up throwing a piece of her away that she can't get back or even remember now. And just bc I would do almost anything to make her happy over myself, I always forget and I remember with a rude awakening now of she does not want to speak with me right now. And I get she may not be herself right now. But then I remember she is done with me. Cut me off. And no words or any actions could make her forgive me or have her look at me and speak to me. That pain always sucks but tonight, I wish I never went to court that day, or maybe never meet with her and that 4 month old boy on that Halloween day where she dressed up as a minion and had that baby boy who was 4 months old, in his stroller, and changed my life that day. But what if I never show up. I'd take all that pain and more if her and those two brothers were better off without me. Lol if anyone actually reads all this.... im sorry, I had to get something out and let me no and I'll make it up to you some way. Im serious lol this weirdo with a beardo has always and will always continue to love you from a distance you can't see, where my presence isn't ever felt by you, so you can forget me and hopefully one day move on and learn to be happy with yourself.
