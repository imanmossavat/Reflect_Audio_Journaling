# Research

This folder contains all exploratory research, experiments, and validation work
conducted during the development of the REFLECT project.

Nothing in this folder is production-critical and everything is purely for testing purposes.
The purpose is to document **how ideas were explored, tested, and evaluated**
before being implemented in the backend or frontend.

## Scope of this folder
- Algorithm exploration (NLP, audio, PII detection, segmentation)
- Model comparisons and evaluations
- Synthetic data generation
- Validation notebooks and analysis
- Design documents supporting technical decisions

Results from this folder informed:
- Backend architecture
- Features
- Model selection for MVP

## Structure overview

- `Design Documents/` – Conceptual and technical design documents
- `PII/` – Experiments and evaluation for PII detection
- `synthetic_data/` – Generated datasets used for testing and validation
- `Testing Notebooks/` – Exploratory notebooks for different AI features
- `Transcription/` – Audio transcription experiments and scripts

## Notes
- Notebooks may overlap in functionality; this is expected in research work
- Some files represent abandoned approaches kept for traceability
- Code quality varies intentionally in favor of speed and experimentation
