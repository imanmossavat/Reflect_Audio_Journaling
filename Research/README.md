# 🧪 REFLECT – The Research Lab

This folder is the "Backstage" of the project. It's where we tested our ideas before putting them into the final app.

## 💡 What is this?
Before we wrote the main app, we had to figure out things like:
- Which AI model is the best at listening?
- How do we find a person's name in a sentence?
- Can we guess a person's mood from their voice?

This folder contains the **Experiments** we did to answer those questions.

## 📂 Folder Map
- **`PII/`**: Tests for finding "Private Info" (names, phones, emails).
- **`Transcription/`**: Tests for turning audio into text.
- **`Testing Notebooks/`**: Rough drafts and messy code where we tried things for the first time.
- **`Design Documents/`**: The original "Blueprints" for how the app was supposed to look and work.
- **`synthetic_data/`**: Tools and scripts for generating fake journal data to test our AI models.
- **`Topic_mapping/`**: Research on how to categorize and map different journal topics.
- **`topic_segmentation_multiple_journals/`**: Early research into splitting long journals into distinct topics.

## ⚠️ Important Info for Developers
**You don't need to run anything in here to use REFLECT.**

This code is purely for history and research. Some of it might be messy or not work perfectly—it's meant for "experts" who want to understand the deep science behind the project.

If you just want to use the journal, stick to the **Backend** and **Frontend** folders! Any new AI experiments should be documented here before being integrated into the main engine.
