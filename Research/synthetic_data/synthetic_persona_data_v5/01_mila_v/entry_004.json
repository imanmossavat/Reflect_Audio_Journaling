  "transcript": "March 20th, 2023\n\nI hope this entry makes sense. I've been re-reading my previous notes to try and understand why I'm so overwhelmed with anxiety today. I feel like I've been repeating the same thoughts over and over in my head: \"What if I don't get an internship? What if I'm not good enough?\" It's like a broken record, playing on repeat. I remember when I first started looking for internships, I felt so desperate. My mother kept telling me to stay positive, that everything will work out, but I couldn't shake off the feeling of rejection. Now, after finally getting an internship, I'm feeling even more anxious. What if it's not enough?.",
