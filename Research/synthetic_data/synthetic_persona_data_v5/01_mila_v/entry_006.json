I have been experiencing a high level of anxiety regarding the internship at Weaver, Erickson and Johnson. Despite receiving multiple rejection letters, I was finally offered an opportunity to participate in their design program as an intern. During my interview, I was bombarded by an overwhelming array of lights and sounds that made it challenging for me to focus. The fluorescent hum of the conference room's overhead lighting created a sense of disorientation, and I found myself struggling to maintain eye contact with Mario Long, our potential employer.",
