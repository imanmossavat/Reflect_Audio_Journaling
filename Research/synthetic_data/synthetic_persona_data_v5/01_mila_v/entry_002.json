I woke up feeling like I'd been punched in the gut - the anxiety is still settling in. It started with an email from my mentor, Joyce Meyer, informing me that Weaver, Erickson and Johnson had offered me an internship, despite not even reaching out to me after I applied months ago. I'm still trying to process how this happened. Was it a mistake? Am I finally being given a chance? As I read through the offer letter, my mind began racing with questions. What does this mean for my future?.",
