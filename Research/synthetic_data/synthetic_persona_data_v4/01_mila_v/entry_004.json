  "transcript": "Today's reflection began with an overwhelming sense of dread as I stared blankly at my computer screen, the fluorescent lights above casting harsh shadows on the walls. My mind immediately began to wander to all the other students who have secured internships, and I couldn't help but wonder if I'm somehow less deserving due to my lack of success so far. I've been attempting to reorganize my notes for our upcoming Media Design project, hoping to clarify my thoughts and alleviate some of the anxiety that has been plaguing me. However, as I delved deeper into my research, my thoughts became increasingly jumbled, and I found myself questioning every decision I make. Reassuringly, I reminded myself of all the times Cynthia West and Tamara Henderson have encouraged me to push forward despite my self-doubt. Their words still resonate with me today, \"You are capable of achieving greatness.\" I've been trying to internalize this mantra, repeating it to myself whenever anxiety threatens to overwhelm me. I also found solace in a conversation I had with Lisa Clark yesterday about the importance of taking calculated risks and not being too hard on oneself. She shared her own experiences with self-doubt and how she's learned to reframe negative thoughts into constructive ones. Her advice has been a balm to my frazzled nerves. Despite this newfound optimism, my mind still kept drifting back to the letter from Dawn Taylor at Douglas Inc. The one that informed me of their job offer for an internship position – something I never expected. It's left me feeling both elated and apprehensive. What if I'm not good enough for this role? What if I fail? As I sit here now, trying to collect my thoughts, I realize that these doubts are a natural part of the growth process. I need to focus on developing a growth mindset, embracing challenges as opportunities for self-improvement rather than threats to my ego. I hope that makes sense, I'm not sure if I'm overthinking this after all. The words of Mr. Keith Mason still echo in my mind – \"It's okay to be uncertain, it means you're on the right path.\" I'll try to remember that as I move forward with this new opportunity.",
