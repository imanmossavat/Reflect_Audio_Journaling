  "transcript": "I stared blankly at my computer screen, the fluorescent lights above casting harsh shadows on the walls. My heart was racing with dread, and I couldn't shake off the feeling of rejection that had been plaguing me for weeks. I've applied to so many internships, but none have responded yet. I'm starting to lose hope. I took a few deep breaths, trying to calm myself down. I reminded myself that it's okay to make mistakes and that this is all part of the learning process. I repeated my mantra: \"I am capable, I am worthy.\" But the doubts lingered. As I began to work on my latest project, I couldn't help but think about what I could've done differently. What if I had applied more times? What if I had tailored my portfolio better? The what-ifs swirled in my head, making it hard to focus. Just then, Tamara sent me a text message - \"Hey, how's it going?\" Her words of encouragement always manage to lift my spirits. I typed out a quick response: \"Not great, but trying to stay positive.\" She replied with a series of emojis and a gentle reminder that I'm doing better than I think. I smiled slightly as I read her message. Cynthia would be proud of me for facing my fears head-on. And Tamara's words of encouragement made sense - I am capable, I am worthy. But what if it's just not enough? The thoughts swirled back in, and I found myself needing a reassurance: \"I'm doing okay, I think.\".",
