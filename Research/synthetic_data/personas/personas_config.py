            "Stage 4 – Shock at job offer: receives a job offer from the internship, feels joy + fear + imposter syndrome.",
            "Stage 5 – Slowly accepting competence: starts to accept she might actually be good at this and imagines a more stable future.",
        ],

        "style_instructions": """
Very literal language, precise descriptions. Occasionally overly formal phrasing mixed with emotional bursts.
Few idioms; avoids metaphors unless rehearsed. Strong sensory descriptions (lights too bright, sounds overwhelming).
Anxiety shows up as repetition and reassurance-seeking phrases ("I hope that makes sense", "I'm not sure if I'm overthinking").
Uses somewhat structured paragraphs and sometimes list-like thinking.
Tone: cautious optimism + analytical reflection. Sentences can get long and meandering when anxious.
