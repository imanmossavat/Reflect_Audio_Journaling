  "transcript": "I have been sitting in my small town apartment for what feels like an eternity, staring at the same four walls as I attempt to process the events that transpired today. The bright fluorescent light overhead seems particularly harsh, making my eyes ache with fatigue. My thoughts are a jumbled mix of emotions, and I'm struggling to discern which feelings are valid. I hope that makes sense. The events that led to this moment have left me feeling overwhelmed, yet simultaneously, I am aware of the progress I've made. As I sit here, trying to untangle the knots of my mind, I find myself dwelling on the anxious thoughts that have been plaguing me. The familiar sense of dread that creeps up when I think about meeting expectations is overwhelming, but I'm starting to notice a pattern - every time I allow myself to get caught up in those fears, something good comes out of it. Like today, for instance, I had a small moment where I surprised myself by speaking up in a way that felt authentic, and yet, my anxiety almost suffocated me afterwards. It's like my brain is constantly playing this game of \"will I be good enough?\" and it's exhausting. The fluorescent light overhead seems to be mocking me now, its harsh glare a reminder of all the things I'm trying to keep at bay. As I sit here, trying to make sense of it all, my mind keeps wandering back to school. The thought of tomorrow's classes fills me with a knot in my stomach - what if I forget something important? What if I stumble over words or trip on the stairs? But as I try to imagine myself navigating these situations, I catch glimpses of moments where I've managed it just fine. Like that time I presented a project and received positive feedback, or when I confidently explained a concept in class without stumbling. It's these tiny successes that give me a boost of confidence, reminding me that I'm capable of handling whatever comes my way.",
