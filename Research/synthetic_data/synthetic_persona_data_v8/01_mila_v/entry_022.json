  "transcript": "Today's events have left me feeling a sense of relief that is palpable, and I can still feel the weight of it lifting off my shoulders. The news about the job offer from the internship has brought an overwhelming sense of joy, yet simultaneously, a crippling fear that threatens to suffocate me. My mind keeps replaying the conversation with Beverly Rogers, our boss, and I'm struggling to reconcile the words she spoke with the reality of the situation. I hope that makes sense - it's all still feeling rather surreal. The more I think about it, the more I realize that this offer represents a significant turning point in my life. The weight of self-worth settles heavy on my chest, a constant companion that I've learned to navigate. In moments of clarity, I see it as a fragile thread – delicate and prone to snapping under the slightest pressure. It's a vulnerable thing, this sense of self-worth, one that requires careful cultivation and attention. When anxiety seeps in, as it often does, it's like a dark cloud casting a shadow over everything I am and ever hope to be. Can I truly say I'm worthy of joy, love, and acceptance when the voices within me whisper doubts and fears? The offer from the internship has brought a glimmer of hope, but what if it's all just a ruse, a cruel trick designed to lull me into complacency?. The weight of the offer still lingers, a mix of excitement and dread that refuses to be shaken. My mind keeps racing with thoughts of what it means to actually start working at the internship - the prospect of being responsible for others, meeting deadlines, and juggling multiple tasks is overwhelming me. I worry that I'll fail somehow, that my neurodiverse brain won't be able to keep up with the demands of a traditional office environment. The thought of having to wear a mask, pretending to be someone I'm not, makes my skin crawl. Every time I think about it, my anxiety spikes and my heart rate quickens, making me feel lightheaded.",
