  "transcript": "Today's relief is palpable, and I can still feel the weight of it lifting off my shoulders. Getting that internship offer was a huge blow to my anxiety - all the worst-case scenarios I'd been conjuring up in my head suddenly seemed less likely. The thought of having a real opportunity to prove myself, to earn my place among people who understand me and appreciate me for who I am, is almost overwhelming. My mind is still racing with thoughts of what this means for my future, but it's a different kind of anxiety now - the good kind that comes from feeling like I'm finally on the right path. The warm bath of relief I described earlier still resonates within me, and I can feel it seeping into my pores like a calming balm. My mind was racing with excitement when I received the news about my internship - all those anxious thoughts about not getting it, about being unprepared, suddenly ceased. For the first time in months, I felt a sense of calm wash over me as I thought about the future unfolding before me. I've always known I was meant to be doing something creative and meaningful with my life, and now that's finally becoming a reality. The weight of uncertainty has lifted, replaced by a sense of purpose and belonging. My loyalty to myself and this opportunity is unwavering - I'm ready to put in the work and prove to myself that I can do it.",
