  "transcript": "Today's relief is palpable. The offer from Henderson-Liu has been accepted, and I am reminded that my persistence paid off. It feels like a weight has been lifted from my shoulders, allowing me to breathe more easily. My mind is still trying to process the implications of this new opportunity, but for now, I can acknowledge the sense of accomplishment and relief that comes with it.\n\nI hope that makes sense. Today's relief is palpable. The offer from Henderson-Liu has been accepted, and I am reminded that my persistence paid off. It feels like a weight has been lifted from my shoulders, allowing me to breathe more easily. My mind is still trying to process the implications of this new opportunity, but for now, I can acknowledge the sense of accomplishment and relief that comes with it.\n\nSocial interaction, on the other hand, is an entirely different story. The thought of navigating this internship brings a wave of anxiety wash over me. What if my colleagues don't like me? What if I say something wrong or accidentally offend someone? I worry about being myself around new people, about revealing too much or not enough.\n\nThe sensory details are overwhelming - the fluorescent lights in the office, the hum of conversations in the background, the feeling of being stuck between rows of cubicles. Each time I try to imagine myself in this environment, my mind becomes a jumble of worst-case scenarios and self-doubt. Will I be able to contribute meaningfully? Will I get lost in the crowd?\n\nIt's ironic that acceptance into Henderson-Liu brings me such relief, while social interaction fills me with dread. Perhaps it's because social interactions require so much 'pretend' - pretending to be confident, pretending to fit in, pretending to like someone just to make them feel better. The more I think about it, the more exhausted I become.\n\nThe thought of having a few close colleagues to rely on for support makes my anxiety spike again - what if they don't understand me? What if we can't connect on a deeper level? My mind starts racing with all the possible ways this could go wrong.",
