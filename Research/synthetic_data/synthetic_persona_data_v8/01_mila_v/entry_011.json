  "transcript": "Today was a day of considerable relief, I believe. My thoughts have been consumed by the weight of uncertainty that has been lifted from my shoulders, allowing me to finally exhale a breath of air. The intense anxiety that had been simmering beneath the surface has begun to dissipate, replaced by a sense of calm that is both unfamiliar and welcome. I hope that makes sense - it's still difficult for me to articulate my emotions in a way that feels coherent. My heart rate remains slightly elevated, but I'm not sure if I'm overthinking. The weight of self-worth. It's a burden I've carried for so long, and yet, today's news feels like a reprieve from its constant scrutiny. The internship offer still resonates within me, a tangible proof that my hard work has been noticed. For the first time in what feels like an eternity, I can focus on my abilities rather than my perceived shortcomings. It's a fleeting sense of confidence, perhaps, but it's enough to sustain me for now.\n\nI find myself wondering if this is why I've always felt like I'm not good enough - because I've been conditioned to believe that my worth is tied to external validation? The anxiety that comes with self-doubt still lingers, a nagging voice in the back of my mind. But today, for the first time, I feel like I can silence it slightly. My hands are steady as I write this, and my breath feels less shallow.\n\nIt's funny how the smallest things can shift our perspective. The relief I feel is not just about the internship itself, but about being seen - recognized for who I am, rather than trying to fit into someone else's mold. It's a fragile sense of self-worth, perhaps, but it's mine.",
