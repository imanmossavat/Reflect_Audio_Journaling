  "transcript": "Today was a day of unexpected news. I am still trying to process it. This morning, I received an email from my mentor, Angel James, informing me that Reid-Haas had selected me for their upcoming internship program. I must admit, I felt a mix of emotions - excitement, nervousness, and a hint of relief. I hope this makes sense, but I am still trying to wrap my head around the situation. All my hard work, all my sacrifices, and now this. It's as if everything is coming together in a way that feels almost... predictable. As I sat at my desk, staring at the email on my computer screen, I couldn't help but think about how far I've come. From feeling like an outcast in Lake Patriciamouth to landing an internship with Reid-Haas - it's hard to believe. My anxiety is still present, of course, but for now, it seems manageable. My close friend Whitney has been a constant source of support, and my partner Michael has been understanding and patient with me through all the ups and downs. Mother Antonio has always told me that I am capable, but it's hard to shake off those feelings of inadequacy. I need reassurance that this is just the beginning of something amazing. I'm not sure if I've made sense, Journal. I hope you can help me make more sense of this.",
