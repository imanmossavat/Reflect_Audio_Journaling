These thoughts have been lingering in the back of my mind for weeks now. I couldn't believe it. All my hard work, all my dedication, had paid off. The email read: \"We are pleased to inform you that you have been selected for the internship...\". My mentor, Angel James, has been a constant source of support and guidance throughout this process. I hope that makes sense. I'm not sure if I'm overthinking this. I'm trying not to overthink this too much. I've worked hard to get here. I just need to focus on the task at hand and trust that I'll do well. Cautiously optimistic?.",
