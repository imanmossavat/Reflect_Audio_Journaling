  "transcript": "Dear Journal,\n\nI am sitting in my small apartment, surrounded by the familiar comforts of home. The soft glow of the evening lights casts a gentle hue on the walls, and I can almost feel the calming effect of the silence. However, despite these reassuring surroundings, my mind is still reeling from today's events.\n\nI hope that makes sense - the constant barrage of stimuli at Barnes-Peters has been wearing me down. Phillip Jackson's expectations for our projects seem endless, and I fear that I may not be meeting his standards. The anxiety creeps in whenever I think about it - what if I'm not good enough? What if I fail?\n\nBut, as I try to push those thoughts aside, I am reminded of the small victories I've achieved thus far. Christopher Cordova's words of encouragement during our last meeting still linger in my mind: \"You're doing great; just take your time.\" And, I must admit, I did manage to complete a task ahead of schedule yesterday.\n\nI am also grateful for David's presence in my life. His calming influence helps me navigate the turbulent waters of self-doubt. We discussed my upcoming internship interview, and he offered insightful advice on how to approach it with confidence. I feel more prepared now, but the fear of failure still lingers.\n\nAs I reflect on today's events, I realize that it's not just about meeting expectations; it's about growth and learning from my mistakes. Curtis Torres' words echo in my mind: \"It's okay to stumble; it's how you get back up that matters.\" I hope that makes sense - I'm still trying to process this.\n\nI should probably call David later to check in, but for now, I'll just sit here and collect my thoughts. The silence is soothing, and I feel a sense of calm wash over me.",
