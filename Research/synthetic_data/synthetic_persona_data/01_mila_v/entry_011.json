  "transcript": "Today was a day I can almost... almost truly say I'm grateful for. The email from Barnes-Peters arrived, and Phillip Jackson told me I got the internship. I feel it in my bones - relief is seeping into my pores like warm water on a cold winter's night. My mind has been racing with possibilities, and I hope that makes sense.\n\nAs I sat in the quiet of my apartment, surrounded by the familiar comforts of home - the soft hum of the lamp on my desk, the faint scent of yesterday's coffee still lingering in the air - I felt a small victory. The walls, once oppressive, now seemed to be whispering encouragement. David walked in and smiled at me; his presence always makes me feel like I'm home.\n\nI must admit, the thought of facing Phillip Jackson again is daunting. What if I say something wrong? What if I don't meet expectations? But for now, as I sit here with this small win under my belt, I can almost taste hope. Maybe it's time to start believing in myself a little more.\n\nI've been thinking about Christopher and his words of encouragement - \"You got this.\" Easy to say when you're not the one worrying about everything. But hearing him say that made me realize maybe I do have this. Maybe I've just been too hard on myself all these years.\n\nDavid walked over, asked how my day was going, and for some reason, it felt like I could finally breathe.",
