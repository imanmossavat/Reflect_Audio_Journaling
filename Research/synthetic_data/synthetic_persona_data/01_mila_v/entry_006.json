  "transcript": "Dear Journal,\n\nI am sitting in my small apartment, surrounded by the familiar comforts of home. The morning light streaming through the window casts a harsh glow on the wall opposite me, making me feel like I'm staring directly into the sun. I should probably close the curtains, but for now, I'll just sit here and try to gather my thoughts.\n\nI've been ruminating on the internship application all morning. I hope that makes sense. It's not like I haven't done it before, but every time I fill out that form, I feel like I'm leaving a part of myself behind. I'm supposed to be confident in my abilities, but what if Phillip Jackson thinks otherwise? What if he sees right through the facade and judges me based on my weaknesses?\n\nI tried calling Christopher again, hoping he could offer some reassurance. His calm demeanor always makes me feel better, but today his voice just seemed... distant. I'm not sure if I'm overthinking this, but I couldn't shake the feeling that he was too polite. Too accommodating.\n\nDavid told me to focus on my strengths and not worry about what others might think. Easy for him to say – he's got a successful career under his belt. What if I'm just not cut out for this? What if Barnes-Peters is just a stepping stone for someone else?\n\nI'm trying to push these thoughts away, but they linger in the back of my mind like a persistent hum. I need to get out there and prove myself, but what if it's all just too much? Too bright, too loud, too overwhelming.",
